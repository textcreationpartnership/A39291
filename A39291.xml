            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin, we are fallen from God grace and glory, unto the Creature, under ſin and Satan's power, and being the children of diſobedience, we are alſo the children of the devil, and the children of wrath. But God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. He hath alſo raiſed up his Son Jeſus, and ſent him to bleſs us, in turning away
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51635:4"/> ever, one of us from our iniquities, by giving himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil world. He alſo himſelf took fleſh and bloud, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil; Even Jeſus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.

            <p>This Verſe is part of that famous Sermon, that our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt preached to the Multitude in the Mount; and therefore ſhould command the greateſt reverence.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of the words is, firſt, Chriſts obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worldlineſs of the World, eſpecially the Gentile world; <hi>for after all theſe things,</hi> namely, <hi>the lust of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, do the Gentiles ſeek.</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="1">1. All men naturally are carnally minded.</p>

            <p>The holy Ghoſt is given to purifie our hearts by the grace of faith.

            </p>
            <p>The Univerſal Church is the body of Chriſt, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the virtue of his Bloud, his Word, Graces, and Comforts, are the life, welfare and ſoul of it. Chriſt our King dwells in this his body, and every member of it, which is his Kingdom, by righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. He covers his body with the robe of his righteouſneſs for their Juſtification, which is their upper garment: <hi>And to the Church, the Lamb's Wife, is granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linen,</hi> her under garment, which is righteouſneſs for Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and purity both in body, ſoul, ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly: And I pray God your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>This Church or Body of Chriſt, looking for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is diligently to be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs. And knowing the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for the ſake of his Body, which is the Church, he became poor, that through his poverty it might be made rich; through him have an acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father of lights, from whom cometh every good gift, and every perfect gift, whether of Nature, of Grace, or of Glory. <hi>For the Lord God is a ſun and ſhield: the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> The ſpirit of power, of love, and of a ſound mind, are his gift, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created the new man, to be renewed in the ſpirit of his mind. For that the ſoul be without knowledge is not good, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51635:9"/> the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified; all other knowledge ſhall vaniſh away, but <hi>this is life eternal, to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly like not to retain God in their knowledge, and are ſo far beſides themſelves, as to ſay unto God, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways: Notwithſtanding that he hath ſaid to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of no underſtanding, that he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour, while they walk in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their minds, having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them. And therefore this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be diſcerned or reproved. Yet to them who were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are light in the Lord, and walk as children of the light, they determine to know nothing, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified. Yea doubtleſs, they count all things but loſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, for whom they ſuffer the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that they may win Chriſt; and be found in him, not having their own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith; that they may know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51635:9"/> unto his death, if by any means they may attain unto the reſurrection of the dead; not as though they had already attained, either were already perfect, but humbly taking God at his word, that then ſhall they know: If they follow on to know the Lord, follow after; if that they may apprehend that for which alſo they are apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus: For the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, hath given unto them the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being enlightned, they know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to them who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places. And though there be ſome that have onely the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the Law and Goſpel, and ſo have but a form of godlineſs; ſuch are they, who profeſs that they know God, yet glorifie him not as God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate, or void of judgment, who reſiſt the truth: Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, reprobate, of no judgment concerning the doctrine or grace of faith: Of this ſort are they which creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women, laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not endure ſound doctrine; but after their own luſts, they heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching ears, and turn away their ears from hearing the truth, and are turned unto fables: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51635:10"/> to godlineſs; being proud, knowing nothing, doting fools, or ſick about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth; ſuppoſing that gain of honour by their doubtful diſputations is godlineſs. From ſuch, let the humble and weak in faith turn away.</p>
            <p>I ſay, though there be ſome, who for the time ought to be Teachers, yet have need that one teach them again, which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God; and are become ſuch, as have need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat. For every one that uſeth milk, is unskilful, and hath no experience in the word of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for he is a babe. Yet for thoſe who are truly enlightned, and have both taſted of, and reliſhed the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and have been made partakers of the Spirit of the Lord, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of councel, and the ſpirit of knowledge, making them of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord; even thoſe that by reaſon of uſe, or habit, or perfection, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil. They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the evil, and cleave to that which is good, being transformed by the renewing of their minds, they prove and try what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God; for a good underſtanding have all they that do thereafter. And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. Hereby know we alſo that we are in him, and he in us. <hi>For if a man keep my words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> But he that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. Chriſt will profeſs to ſuch a one, Depart from me, thou worker of iniquity, I never knew thee. But he who loves God, not in word, or in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51635:10"/> tongue, but in deed and in truth, is known of him, and knoweth God, and approves things that are excellent; even whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report. Growing alſo in grace, abounding in love more and more, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſenſe, minding, ſavouring, favouring the things of the Spirit, as they that are after the Spirit. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, being ſpiritually minded, ſerve him in newneſs of ſpirit, mind not high things, but content themſelves with mean things. Take not thought for their life, what they ſhall eat, or what they ſhall drink, nor yet for the body what they ſhall put on; knowing the life to be more worth than meat, and the body than raiment; and that meats are but for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them. And the body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And though there are many whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame; men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whoſe belly God filleth with his hid treaſures: who ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? truſting in uncertain riches, that will be rich, and therefore minding altogether earthly things, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred, or been ſeduced from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows, and turn thereby enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, which ſhould be their glory; whereby the world ſhould be crucifi'd to them, and they unto the world, whoſe end is to be drowned in deſtruction and perdition. Yet are there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51635:11"/> ſome of the mind of the Spirit, that godlineſs with contentment is great gain; and therefore having food and raiment, their converſation being in heaven, are, without covetouſneſs, content with ſuch things as they have: knowing they brought nothing into this world, and it is certain they can carry nothing out: who in reſpect of want have learned, whatſoever ſtate they are in, therewith to be content: Knowing how to be abaſed, and how to abound; every where, and in all things inſtructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need; careful for nothing, in every thing by prayer, and ſupplication, with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, making their requeſts known unto God their heavenly Father, who knoweth that they have need of all theſe things, namely, food and raiment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take no thought what to eat or drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to be clothed; for he that feeds the fowls, will much more feed them; and arrays the Lilies of the field, and clothes the graſs, will much more array (if need be) however cloath the little in faith. And this ſhould ſilence all our doubts, cares, and fears, as to our protection and proviſion for this life, that if God hath not ſpared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things. While worldlings are cumbred with many things, and troubled about much ſerving, the minds of heavenly believers are taken up with the one thing neceſſary.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51635:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> glory without it: for, we are kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation. As many as are ordained to eternal life, are ordained to believe. God hath from the beginning choſen us to Salvation, through belief of the truth, that ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> might dwell in our hearts by Faith, which is the Bond of our Union with him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> Prayes for them which ſhall believe on him, that all may be one in us; by vertue of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through Faith, are we born from above; Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Believeth that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is born of God: as many as received him, even to them that believe on his name, were born, not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God: We are Juſtified and Reconciled to God by Faith; being Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and truſting, or believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are made accepted in the Beloved, in whom we have Redemption, through Faith, in his Blood; the Forgiveneſs of Sins; Adoption into the number and priviledge of God's children: As many as received him, to them gave he power, right, or priviledge, to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name: We are alſo ſanctified by Faith that is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God now puts no difference between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> purifying their hearts by Faith; God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. Now this ſaving Grace of Faith, is the Almighty Work of the Spirit of God, whereby, with the heart, we believe all that God hath ſpoken, becauſe he hath ſpoken it: It is a believing this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and accounting of it worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came into the World to ſave ſinners; It is a believing the record that God gave of his Son, and this is the record, That God hath given
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51635:19"/> to us, Eternal Life, and this life is in his Son. This is he that came by Water and Blood, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> not by Water only, but Water and Blood: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to believe, for there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe three are one; And there are three that bear witneſs in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one: if we receive the witneſs of Men, the witneſs of God is greater; for, this is the witneſs of God which he hath teſtified of his Son. He that believeth not God hath made him a Liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son; I ſay, it is a believing, that all things are, or muſt be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Kingdom; not becauſe of Mens ſaying, or Teſtimony only, but purely upon the bare Word of God, and his Son, and his Spirit; for, in the mouth of theſe three Witneſſes, every Word of God in the Holy Scriptures is eſtabliſht: It is a confeſſing with the mouth the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and believing with the heart that God hath raiſed him from the Dead. It is an humble, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearty receiving, or accepting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Lord and Saviour, and truſting in his Allſufficiency, as our one and only Mediatour, through the vertue, value and power of his <hi>Prophetical, Sacerdotal,</hi> and <hi>Regal</hi> Offices, to bring us through all hazards and difficulties, in a way of Grace to Glory, in ſeaſon, and ſafely. He that thus believeth, and continueth to live by Faith, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life. This Faith, by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given to believers, worketh Love, and worketh by Love: The Love of God is ſhed abroad in the hearts of true Believers, by the Holy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51635:20"/> Spirit, by knowing and believing the Love that God hath to us, we come to love God: Who can know, and believe heartily, that God is Love, and not love him? God is Love; in this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the World, that we might live through him. Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins: we love him, becauſe he firſt thus loved us. All God's graces together conſtitute this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace, but Love is the life and ſoul of it; even Gods love to us, and our love to him, and our love to each other, he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: There is a threefold love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the godly, a love of Union, a love of Communion and Complacency, and a love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Communication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Like as was between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> the Soul of <hi>Jonathan</hi> was knit with the Soul of <hi>David, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> loved him as his own Soul. <hi>Jonathan</hi> delighted much in <hi>David,</hi> then <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, becauſe he loved him as his own Soul; and <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſtript himſelf of the Robe that was upon him, and gave it to <hi>David,</hi> and his Garments, even to his Sword, and to his Bow, and to his Girdle; and ſaid moreover to <hi>David,</hi> whatſoever thy Soul deſireth I will even do it for thee. There is between God and the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a love of Union, My Beloved is mine and I am his. The Bond on Gods part is his Spirit, hereby know we that we dwell in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he in us, becauſe he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of his Spirit; he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit. The Bond on our part is Faith working by Love; <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelleth in the heart by Faith; he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God. This is the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51635:20"/> moſt intimate Union, as near as Head and Members, Root and Branch, Man and Wife, Corner-ſtone and the Building; which may be ſevered, cut off, ſeparated, and diſunited: But, this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Spiritual Believers, is inſeparable; becauſe wrought, preſerved and maintained by the Holy Ghoſt, who is God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From whence followeth a near Communion. Truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Can two walk together except they be agreed? There is an Agreement between God and all True Believers by Covenant; the Covenant and Agreement that was once betwixt Them, and Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Hell and Death, is diſannulled; and, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with God by Sacrifice by all the Saints: and, by means and vertue of this Holy Agreement it is, that God and his People walk together in every Holy Duty and Ordnance; there is a Holy Communion between them; a Fellowſhip in Deſires and Loves; I am my Beloveds, and his deſire is towards me: With my Soul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my Spirit within me will I ſeek thee early: He brought me into his Banquetting Houſe, and his Banner over me was Love. Behold thou art fair, my Love, behold thou art fair, ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Beloved Spouſe! Tell me, oh thou whom my Soul loveth, where thou feedeſt, ſaith the Spouſe to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Here is a Love-Communion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but expreſſions of Love between them, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joy alſo. Draw me, We will run after thee. The King hath brought me into his Chambers: We will be glad and rejoyce over thee with Joy, he will reſt in his Love, he will Joy over thee with Singing; in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Praiſes we hold up our Communion with him. Oh my Dove, that art in the cleft of the Rock, in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51635:21"/> ſecret place of the Stairs, let me ſee thy Countenance, let me hear thy Voice, for ſweet is thy Voice, and thy Countenance is comely: and, doubtleſs, he that calls upon us to Pray, will vouchſafe his ear to hear, and a heart to anſwer. Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear: This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us Pray, and granteth our Requeſt; ſo he heareth our Praiſes, and Thankſgivings: for the Mercies obtained by Prayer, we are to offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe to God continually, that is, the Calves of our Lips, giving Thanks, or Confeſſing his Name: This is to Glorifie God, he that offereth Praiſe Glorifieth me. There is an Active and Paſſive Praiſing of God; an Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. There is alſo a Love of Communication and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence which is Mutual, between God and the Godly. God is a Communicative Good he is never weary of giving: We are too often weary of asking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. God is good, and doth good. He that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things: he that will give grace and glory, will withhold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good. If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him.</p>
            <p>We have nothing to give to God but what we have from him; the beſt thing we have to give him is our heart; My Son give me thy heart: Our whole Man, and our whole duty is intirely to be preſented to God as a living reaſonable ſervice, and yet when we have done all we are but unprofitable ſervants Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto himſelf? Good Lives is profitable to all things and perſons, but not unto God; we cannot add any thing to God's Eſſential Perfections. God is ſo good, that a Cup of cold Water given to a Diſciple, in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall not loſe its reward. Our Love of Benevolence to God, is, by his gracious power, a willing what God wills, and a nilling what he nills; a doing what he commands us, as he commandeth us; and a not doing what he forbids us, becauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us; when we are good our ſelves, and good to our ſelves, and do good to others; when we forget not to do good, and to Communicate, as we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but, do good unto all men, eſpecially unto them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51635:22"/> who are of the houſhold of Faith, and remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which ſuffer adverſity, as being our ſelves alſo in the Body: then are we, if I may ſay, good to God, though our goodneſs extendeth not to him, but to the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the excellent in whom we are to delight.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Real Union, Communion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between Chriſtians in Love; Every Saint loves all Saints: By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another; and, by this we know, that we are paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the Brethren; he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abideth in death. Spiritual Love amongſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is an evidence of Spiritual Life; as ſoon as we begin to Love, we then begin to Live. Such a love as was between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> which was a Love of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Complacency, and Benevolence, muſt be between all true Chriſtians: So it was in the Primitive times, notwithſtanding their diverſities of Judgments, in ſmaller matters, the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one ſoul; neither ſaid any of them, that any of the things which he poſſeſſed was his own, but they had all things common in Charity; neither was there any among them that lacked; for, as many as were Poſſeſſors of Lands, or Houſes, ſold them, and brought the Priſes of the things that were ſold, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet; and diſtribution was made unto every Man according as he had need. Were all our Doubtful Diſputations laid aſide, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Faith, and Faithfulneſs, the Truth without Controverſie, Love without Diſſimulation, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs profeſſed and practiſed amongſt us; nay, were but this one grace and duty of Charity, without which we are nothing, truly Known, Believed, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51635:22"/> Exerciſed in the midſt of us; How ſoon might we all meet together in the Primitive Pattern and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe? if moſt of our Praying, Preaching, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing were of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God who is love, and the Love of God towards us well known, would certainly beget Chriſtian Love and Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God: He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love. In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſins; hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us. Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another: No man hath ſeen God at any time; if we love one another, God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Behold here the great Argument breeding and augmenting love in and among Chriſtians by profeſſion! God is love, known to be ſo, in giving and ſending his only begotten Son into the World: This Charity of God to us is the Soul of our Souls. Charity is the Soul of our Religion, not Bodily only; for, though we beſtow all our goods to feed the Poor, and give our Bodies to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth nothing. The true Charity, the Chari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Every grace of God is good, great, lovely and precious, of infinite neceſſity; As Faith, Hope, Meekneſs, Temperance, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the greateſt of theſe is Charity in ſincerity. Above all things we ſhould have fervent Charity among our ſelves; for, Charity covereth a multitude of Sins, and Love covereth all Sins, ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>

Oh, if the Charity of every one of us all towards each other abounded but exceedingly, What cauſe of Thankſgivings to God would this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Godly or Charitable. There could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be any want in theſe Kingdoms, if there were no want of Charity; Charity is all for doing good, both
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51635:23"/> to all Souls and Bodies; of what quality, rank, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoever, to high and low, rich and poor together: Charity is full of Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks for all men; for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, or eminent place, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; for, this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>By Charity God will every body ſhould have food and raiment; and every Soul its portion in due ſeaſon. Charity would have every Biſhop and Miniſter, as it were another <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for going about, doing good, and Preaching this Kingdom of God and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; or another <hi>Paul,</hi> who counted not his life dear unto himſelf, ſo that he might finiſh his courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry, which he received of the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God, Preaching the Kingdom of God, not ſhunning to declare unto them all the counſel of God, that he might be pure from the blood of all men: charging alſo other Goſpel Miniſters to take heed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he purchaſed with his own Blood; ſetting them in himſelf an Example of unwearied diligence, in Watching, Faſting, Praying, Preaching; not ceaſing to warn every one night and day with Tears: Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, not keeping back any thing that was profitable unto them, but ſhewed, and taught them publickly, and from houſe to houſe; beſides miniſtring unto his own neceſſities with his own hands, and to them that were with him. If a Brother or Siſter be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and deſtitute of daily Food, Charity ſaith not,

               </gap>rity, while proud; I have no hope of ſuch: pride is for contention and diviſion; only by pride cometh contention: Charity is for peace and unity againſt both. The covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth, count their gain to be Godlineſs; an heart they have exerciſed with covetous practiſes; curſed children, which have forſaken the right way,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51635:24"/> and go aſtray, becauſe they love the wayes of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; theſe are for Uſe upon Uſe, to ſwallow up the poor alive; From theſe Perſons, and Practiſes, the Good Lord deliver the King and his Kingdoms: O my Soul come not thou into their ſecret, unto the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Men proud and covetous, mine honour be not thou united. But Charity is humble, and the humble are Charitable; Charity is not puffed up with pride, or knowledge, not cruel, but liberal, and deviſeth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral things, and by liberal things it ſhall ſtand. It is manifeſt, that theſe two cruel evils had a great hand in our late mutual devourings; and, except God by his wonderful Power and Providence interpoſe, we are ſtill in Eminent and Imminent danger of them.</p>
            <p>The fear of God is another principal part of this Kingdom of God: Indeed if we take it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſenſe, it is the ſum of Religion; but, take it as a Grace and the fear of God is to hate evil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it: the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life; to depart from the ſnares of death, it is the way of life; and this way of life is above to the Wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath; which can never be, but by firſt departing from ſin upon Earth. Unto Man, God ſaith, Behold! the fear of the Lord that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil is Underſtanding. This fear of God is bred in the heart by the love of God: Ye that love the Lord hate evil; perfect love caſteth out the fear of bondage, and lets in the fear of reverence: for this we have Gods Promiſe; The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and <hi>David</hi> their King, and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs, in the latter dayes: they honour the King beſt who fear God moſt. Nothing like goodneſs to beget the fear of God, and due and true honor to the King; Love the Brotherhod, fear God, honor the King are linked
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51635:25"/> together. The fear of God is a fear to ſin, out of love and reverence to the Majeſty of God: he who truly fears God, fears nothing but ſin, and none but G d and for God. How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God, ſaith he, who is tempted to ſin? while he doth good, he is not afraid of the Power, becauſe he is the Miniſter of God for good to him; but, when he doth evil he is afraid; for, he beareth not the Sword in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil; otherwiſe he is not afraid, of him that can kill the Body, and after that hath no more that he can do, becauſe he fears him which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell. This God he fears to ſin againſt, and therefore fears not to be caſt by him into Hell: While it is his care to cleanſe himſelf from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and to perfect holineſs in his fear, and to work out his ſalvation with fear and trembling. This fear is Filial, and Reverential, a Child-like fear, afraid to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor God; If I be a Father, ſaith God, Where is my honor? An earthly Father expects and deſerves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from his child, ſo doth our heavenly Father from his children. The honor of reverence in carefulneſs to pleaſe him, and fearfulneſs to offend him; This is the fear of the Lord which tendeth to life, and he that hath it ſhall abide ſatisfied; he ſhall not be viſited with evil, in this fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence.</p>
            <p>The love and fear of God together breeds the beſt obedience, which is the beſt Sacrifice: the fear of God reſtrains from ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Principles of new and true obedience, are Faith and Love, or Faith working by Love, called in Scripture, the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith; neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by love. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſtraineth us to live, not unto our ſelves, but unto him, who for us died and roſe again. The obedience we owe to God in this Kingdom of Grace, is Active and Paſſive; Active, not doing what he forbids, not walking in the Counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of ſinners, nor ſitting in the ſeat of the ſcornful; not walking after the Fleſh, according to the courſe of this World; but walking after the Spirit, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God from the heart; doers of the word, and not hearers onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Church, peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, they are at ſuit with God and Man for it; and, having a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, who is King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, King of peace; and a wonderful Counſellor, both to hear and plead their cauſe; the Spirit, the Word of Promiſe, and the Wiſe, Pure and Peaceable, to be their Witneſſes, doubt not but to carry it in Gods good time, againſt Sathan, and the World, who are Enemies and Adverſaries to the Peace and Proſperity of Sion: That the fruits of Righteouſneſs may be ſown in peace of them that make peace, is the end of their deſires of peace, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> all may live to the glory and praiſe of God; for, herein is our heavenly Father glorified, when we bear much fruit: The fruit of holineſs to God, the fruit of righteouſneſs to Men; for, the fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in all Goodneſs, and Righteouſnes, and Truth, Love, Joy, Peace, Longſuffering, Gentleneſs, Faith, Faithfulneſs, Meekneſs, Temperance, Patience, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Brotherly-kindneſs, Charity: The beſt ſowing-time for theſe Seeds of Holineſs is in the fair weather of Peace; though Perſecution, through Sanctification of the Spirit, may be good to root them, and make them grow where they are ſown: And therefore we ſhould follow after the perſons, the things, the means that make for peace; follow peace with all men, till
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51635:28"/> we overtake and catch it, as hunters, without wearineſs, till they have got their game. Eſpecially Magiſtrates and Miniſters, the great Peace-makers and keepers, in Church and State, are to follow it amain, with, and for each other, who are Commanders of it, and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to it: they who Preach the Goſpel of Peace, ſhould be for the Peace of the Goſpel. The beſt way to gain all to follow after Peace, is for the Leaders to begin, hold on, and hold out. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another; and the Lord of Peace himſelf give us Peace always by all means. The way to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind; to have and to hold the God of Love and Peace in the midſt of us, is to live in peace: he is not a Son of God, nor a true Son of the Univerſal Church, that is not a Son of Peace. The Kingdom of God, which is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, Righteouſneſs and Peace, is alſo a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; Every Grace hath Joy in it, and being well exerciſed hath Joy accompanying it: Joy is the flower of Grace, rejoycing with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory, is the effect of believing in, and loving of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance, and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance Joy; they that ſow in Tears ſhall reap in Joy; he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing: the ſeeds of Grace, with the ſhowers of Grace, and the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, bring forth a crop of Joy; they who walk in the fear of the Lord will live in the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt; Joy, or Rejoycing is a Duty, a Grace, a Bleſſing Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal: Rejoyce in the Lord evermore, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; rejoyce not that the Spirits are ſubject to you, but rather rejoyce that your Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51635:28"/> they who are Juſtified by Faith, and have peace with God, through our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by whom they have acceſs into the Grace wherein they ſtand, rejoyce in hope of the glory of God. The Lord is to be ſerved with Joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart, for the abundance of all things. The Light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon the Godly puts gladneſs in their hearts, more than in theirs whoſe Corn and Wine encreaſeth; everlaſting joy ſhall be upon the heads, and in the hearts of the ranſomed of the Lord, they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away: this Joy of the Lord is their ſtrength, it is ſtrength to their outward man; it is not only ſtrength to, but the very ſtrength of the inward man. A ſound heart is the life of the fleſh; What is it that makes the heart ſound, and conſequently the body, but grace and joy exerciſed effectually? <hi>David,</hi> a man after God's own heart, whoſe heart was ſound in Gods ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, How often do we find him rejoycing in God, in his Word, delighting in the Godly, and in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Thou art the God of my ſtrength, ſaith he; How! O ſend out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy Holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles, then will I go unto God my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy, the gladneſs of my joy: The God of his exceeding joy was the God of his ſtrength; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want joy that make God their joy, the God of hope, the God they hope and truſt in; the God they hope to ſee face to face will fill them with all joy and peace, in believing, that they may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghoſt: By this ſpirit in the inner man, the Father of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will grant unto them, according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might, with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51635:29"/> long-ſufferings, with joyfulneſs, that they can do, and ſuffer all things through <hi>Chriſt</hi> which ſtrengthens them; they know both how to be abaſed, and how to abound every where, in all things inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need; to ſuffer for the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the name and power of Godlineſs; for, all that will live Godly in <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> ſhall ſuffer perſecution: but they rejoyce, in as much as they are made partakers of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings; that, when his glory ſhall be revealed, they may be glad alſo with exceeding Joy. The great fight of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly whilſt they are made a gazing-ſtock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly whilſt they become Companions of them that were ſo uſed; and the ſpoiling of their Goods they take joyfully, knowing in themſelves, that they have in Heaven a better, and an induring ſubſtance: What is Joy, but the Exultation, Dilatation, and Enlargement of a holy heart, running the wayes of Gods Commandments with delight, power, patience, and perſeverance, working therein a fervent willingneſs to be, and readineſs to do and ſuffer any thing whereby God may be glorified; a rejoycing in the way of Gods Teſtimonies as much as in all riches; the unſearchable riches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the riches of Grace, and the riches of Glory, are the matter of this Joy; the beholding, by faith, as in a Glaſs, this glory of God, our relation to him and his dear Son; and thereby our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ingrace, and right and title to glory, are means both to beget, encreaſe, and perfect this joy, which is the ſtrength of the heart: What is the ground of our hope and confidence, when our fleſh and our heart fails us, but God our exceeding Joy, who is the ſtrength of our hearts, becauſe he is our portion for ever? All true believers muſt enter into the Joy of their Lord, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch is ſo great and glorious, that it cannot

And therefore, though now for a ſeaſon, if need be, the people of God are in heavineſs, through manifold temptations, yet they greatly rejoyce, and Joy in the God of their Salvation. This is their time to weep, lament, and be ſorrowful, while the men of the World rejoyce, but their ſorrow ſhall be turned into Joy, and Worldings Joy into weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gnaſhing of teeth for ever. The weeping of the godly may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning; for a ſhort night of ſorrow, they ſhall have an everlaſting day of Joy: as a Woman when ſhe is in travel hath ſorrow, becauſe her hour is come; but, as ſoon as ſhe is delivered of the Child, ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth no more the anguiſh, for Joy that a Man is born into the World: In like manner, thoſe little children, of whom the faithful Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> travel in birth with until <hi>Chriſt</hi> be formed in them, What is their hope or Joy, or Crown of Rejoycing, but their New-born Babes, through their Miniſtery, come unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature, or age, of the fulneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> theſe are their glory, and joy, in the preſence of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at his coming, when they ſhall be preſented faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding Joy; for, when <hi>Christ</hi> who is their life ſhall appear, then ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51635:30"/> from above, believe and wait for the promiſe of his coming; becauſe he hath ſaid, I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from you. The end of all things, ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Word, is, that his joy might remain in them, and that their joy may be full. The end of their fellowſhip, and communion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one another, is, that their Joy may be full even here upon Earth. Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father, ſaith he, in my name, he will give it you: hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name, ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your Joy may be full: That eternal life, namely <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which was with the Father, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted from the beginning, which the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians heard and ſaw with their eyes, which they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and their hands handled; for, this Life was manifeſted, and they declared it, that they might have fellowſhip one with another; and truly their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was with the Father, and with his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> came into the World, and lived in it, to the end their Joy might be full: If there be ſuch a fulneſs of Joy in the Kingdom of grace, What a fullneſs of Joy will there be in the Kingdom of glory? But, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a moment; at the longeſt, his hopes and his joyes at death will give up their Ghoſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; while the righteous have hope in their death, that will not leave them aſhamed; and the upright ſhall dwell in the preſence of God, where they ſhall ſhout aloud for joy; he ſhall guide them with his eye, and counſel unto death, and afterwards receive them to glory, and ſo ſhall they ever be with the Lord, in whoſe preſence there is fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore; unto

            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom of God, as it is a Kingdom of grace, ſo alſo a Kingdom of glory: A glorious Kingdom is the Kingdom of God, infinitely tranſcending all the glory of all the Kingdoms of this World. The tongues of Angels, and the tongues of Men cannot ſufficiently expreſs, or their underſtandings conceive the glory of this Kingdom of glory: Since the beginning of the World, Men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. O how great is that goodneſs which he hath laid up for them that fear him, which he hath wrought for them that truſt in him before the Sons of Men! O could we ſee and hear, and taſte, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did <hi>Solomon's,</hi> the Wiſdom of God, the Houſe, namely the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he hath built; the Meat of his Table, and the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Servants, and the attendance of his Miniſters, and their Apparel, their Words, Works, and Wages, their Acclamations and ſhoutings with Joy, there would be no more ſpirit in us than was in her. The one half of the greatneſs of his Wiſdom, and of the greatneſs of this goodneſs cannot be told us; it infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceedeth all the fame of report; happy are thoſe Men, happy are thoſe Servants, which ſtand continually before this God, to hear, and ſee, and enjoy this his Wiſdom and Goodneſs; happy are the People, in the account of the World, that enjoy the honors, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and riches of this World; but, in reality, happy are they who have God for their God.

This Kingdom is made up all of glory, the three glorious perſons; namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, are the glory in it, and of it; there dwells the God of glory, the Lord of glory, the Spirit of glory. This Kingdom of glory is not Gods glory, God is the glory of this kingdom of glory. There is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; theſe derive their glory from the Sun; there is one glory of the Sun of righteouſneſs, another glory of the Angels, another glory of the Saints, theſe alſo receive their glory from the glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs; there are Angels of glory, Saints, Veſſels of glory, Thrones of glory, Crowns of glory; no perſons, no manner of things, to render this Kingdom of God inglorious: God hath no pleaſure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him; the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or maketh a Lie; Sin, Satan, and Sinners muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more come there: this Kingdom will have a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py riddance of them.

God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all: this Light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehendeth it not. The bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who only hath Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, dwelleth in the Light, which no Man can approach unto, whom no Man hath ſeen, nor can ſee, becauſe he covereth himſelf with Light, as with a Garment; for now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, or in a Riddle: God, his Word, his Works of Nature, Grace, and Glory; every thing we ſee, hear, taſte, touch, ſmell, hath an inexplicable, and unutterable myſtery in it; now we know but in part, but in the kingdom of glory we ſhall know, as we are known. It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; it doth not yet appear to us what God is: Who can tell what God is? but, we know, that when God-man ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for, we ſhall ſee him as he is, not in a Glaſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but then face to face, which will be our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God; we walk by Faith, and not by Sight here; but in Heaven we walk by ſight, and not by faith; perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, and to underſtand the Myſteries of Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity; and, that great Myſtery of Godlineſs, without Controverſy, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, Juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on in the World, received up into Glory, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and among the Gentiles, even the unſearchable Riches of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to make all men ſee, what is the

And the Gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day, for there ſhall be no night there: a pure River of water of Life, clear as Chryſtal therein, proceedeth out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb: In the midſt of the Street of it, and on either ſide of the River was there the Tree of Life, bearing Twelve manner of fruits every Month, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> will give to him that overcometh to eat of, that he may live for ever.

This perfect beatifical Viſion of God, in Heavenly Glory, will breed unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſweet fruition in the neareſt Union, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Communication, between God and the Godly, as there is an Union in grace between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Chriſtian, by Faith, through the ſpirit, which is inſeparable: So there is an Union in glory, or a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Union between the glorious Trinity and all the glorified, beyond all apprehenſion and expreſſion now; and the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; not one in Eſſence with God, in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but one by reſemblance, or ſimilitude; an oneneſs there will be betwixt God and all the Godly glorified, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpaſſing all other unions here below: The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Husband and Wife, one Fleſh; of King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, one Kingdom; Soul and Body, one Perſon; Root and Branches, one Tree; Foundation, Corner-ſtone, and Building, one Houſe; are very great and Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but this of Grace and Glory much greater, and far more unconceivable: thoſe are as ſhadows, and ſo paſs away; this ſubſtantial and eternal: for Brethren to dwell (even) together in the unity of the Spirit; in the unity of that Faith, which worketh by Love in the bond of Peace. Behold how good and how pleaſant it is, beyond all expreſſion, apprehenſion, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation!
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51635:34"/> But, for the General Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, to dwell even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity, with Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, through all Eternity, in that glory which God the Father gave unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given unto them, that they may be one, even as the Father and his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> are one; I in them, ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one: How good, and how pleaſant a ſight will this be to behold? here, and onely here, will the Natural and Intellectual eye be ſatisfied, with ſeeing the hearts of all knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Love; and unto all Riches of the full aſſurance of Underſtanding; to the acknowledgment of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, and of the Father, and of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and, that Myſtery of Godlineſs, which, without controverſie is ſo great; God manifeſted in the Fleſh, becoming one with us in Nature, that we might become one with him in Grace and Glory; for, by one Spirit are we all Baptized into one Body, for the body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being many, are one Body; ſo alſo is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones; as Head and Members make up but one Body, ſo the Son of God, who is alſo the Son of Man; and the Sons of God, which are as head and members, make up one Myſtical <hi>Chriſt:</hi> a Myſtery great, beyond the capacity of Angels to conceive; which things they deſire to prye, or look into, and is the ſubject of their continual and juſt admiration: The full Viſion and Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof will adminiſter alſo to every glorified Saint matter of the higheſt Adoration, and everlaſting Conſolation. Were this one Promiſe, of one heart and one way in the fear and worſhip of God accompliſhed in the midſt of us, that we might be his People, and he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51635:35"/> our God, to rejoyce over us, to do us all the good he hath promiſed us; What greater, or better thing could we deſire on this ſide Heaven? why, in the Kingdom of God there will be one heart, and one way, and one work for ever: There will be no need of beſeeching Brethren by the Name of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to ſpeak the ſame thing; that there be no diviſions among them; that they be perfectly joyned together, in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment. God, and all the Godly will there be ſo well known to each other, through the Light of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, that there will not be the leaſt ſhadow of diviſion, or fear of any ſeparation. This happy, perfect, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Union, is the foundation of that Communion and Fellowſhip between God, Angels, and Juſt Men made perfect, which is unſpeakable and full of glory. What Fellowſhip there is between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, is a Secret to us, if not to Angels, and Secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but, a mutual glorifying each other there was, is, and will be, from everlaſting to everlaſting: and, how far the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints and Servants of the Lord ſhall be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Enjoyment and Knowledge hereof in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory, is ſo much above the reach of our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that it ought to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruly, our Fellowſhip will be with the Father, and with his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> through the Spirit, and with all the bleſſed Angels, in ſuch a manner and meaſure, as no Tongue can utter, or Mind conceive. For Saints to draw nigh to God, and for God to draw nigh to them in Mercy even here, How good is it? It is good for me to draw near to God. Draw me, we will run after thee, is the Language and Prayer of every one that is Godly: but, when by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to God, we are come to God, and are not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51635:35"/> only nigh him, but with him; How comfortable will that Communion be? It will be a Communion in the higheſt honors, the ſweeteſt pleaſures, and the trueſt riches: Them that honor me, ſaith the Lord, I will honor. It will be our heavenly happineſs to receive honor from God, and to give honor to God; this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor have all his Saints. Honor is ſuch an excellency, that is naturally deſired of every one; ſinners and unbelievers, who ſeek not the honor that cometh from God only, which is the only true honor, rather than live without it, will receive honor one of another, though thereby they are hindred from the honor of believing in God, and in his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which is, to give all hon r to him to whom honor belongs, and to receive all honor from him, who is the only Author of every good and perfect gift. The making Man a little while inferior to, or lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and crowning him with glory and honor in a ſtate of innocency, made <hi>David</hi> fall into admiration; Lord, What is Man, that thou art mindful, or takeſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; or the Son of Man, that thou viſiteſt, or makeſt account of him? What admiration will it occaſion to the glorified, to be made like to, or equal with the Angels in Heaven; and then, and there, to wear Crowns of Glory, Honour, Righteouſneſs, and Life, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall give unto all them that are faithful unto death, and love and long for his appearing? When <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory; not only like unto Angels, but unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Lord of glory. It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but, we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, in our bodies. We look for the Saviour, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who will change our vile Bodies, that they may be faſhioned like unto his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51635:36"/> glorious Body, which is uncorruptible and immortal: This corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal muſt put on immortality. Our Bodies were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth. The works of God are all wonderful, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein: This curious Piece of Mans Body is ſo full of wonderful myſterious works, in every part and member thereof, that all the Anatomiſts in the World could never find out, or deſcribe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its excellency. It is quite beyond the reach of the underſtandings of all Souls, to comprehend the height, length, depth, and breadth of thoſe excellencies that are contained in the Body of Man: Indeed, ſin hath depraved it, and deprived it of much of its glory; yet remains there that majeſty upon it, that commands reverence from all other capable creatures. There are Bodies Terreſtrial and Celeſtial, each of which have their glory, the one before, the other after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: But, ſome Men will ſay, How are the Dead raiſed up? and, With what Body do they come? God giveth it a Body as it pleaſeth him: It is ſown a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, it is raiſed a Spiritual Body; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it is raiſed in glory, a glorious Body; Like unto the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> perfectly free from all ſin; from Natural and Moral infirmities: no more pains or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever. Perfect and perpetual health and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will diffuſe it ſelf into every member. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtandings of Men, from the beginning to the end of the World, cannot conceive, nor tongues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or ſet forth, the Glory wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But, Why do I ſpeak of what is unſpeakable, and undertake to write of that which is ſo unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? He that was caught up into Paradiſe, which is the third Heaven, heard unſpeakable words, which it is not poſſible or lawful for a Man to utter; and, if it were poſſible for them to be uttered, it would be impoſſible for them to be underſtood: The Ear will have its perfect hearing there. Doth not the Ear try words, ſaith <hi>Job?</hi> no need of trying words in Heaven, where every one is a perfect Man, not offending in a Word. It is natural to all, to natural Men eſpecially, to ſpend their time in nothing elſe but either to tell or hear ſome new thing: as natural, ſo ſpiritual perſons have their delectation, the one in hearing what Men ſay, the other in hearing what God ſays.</p>
            <p>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his People, and to the Saints, even that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding. Faith, and all other Graces and Comforts, comes by hearing the Word of God Preached and Read; the benefit of hearing here in this life, under the means of Grace, is an unvaluable bleſſing. What glory then will it be to hear of nothing but glory? every one there will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive to hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, who hath the words of eternal life. If all bare <hi>Chriſt</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wondred at the gracious words which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of his Mouth, when on Earth, in his eſtate of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51635:37"/> humiliation, much more will all in Heaven bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and admire, and adore the glorious words which will proceed out of his mouth, in his ſtate of Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his mouth is moſt ſweet, his words are altogether lovely: here, here only will the Ear be ſatisfied with hearing. Let me hear thy voice, ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Church his Spouſe, for ſweet is thy voice. If the ſanctified voice of his Church, in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> be ſo ſweet to <hi>Chriſt</hi> now; How ſweet will her glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied voice be to him in his glory? and, How ſweet will <hi>Chriſts</hi> voice be then and there to his triumphant Church? his voice will be ſweeter than all theirs. In Heaven there only is the hearing ear, and the perſons and things worthy to be heard: What Inſtruments of Muſick there will be, and Muſicians to time and tune, and ſound them, to delight and raviſh the ſenſe of hearing, God only knows. The voice of Harpers harping with their Harps have there been heard. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick upon Rivers of Water make the ſweeteſt and moſt ſolemn ſound: At Gods right hand there are Rivers of pleaſures, where there will be ſuch Muſick, as will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the ears and hearts of Angels and Saints for ever. What ſpiritual Meat and Drink there will be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to delight and pleaſe the ſpiritual taſte or palate, who can tell? Sure I am, there will be feeding and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Heaven. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> will be the true Bread as truly in Heaven without Ordinances, as on Earth in his Ordinances; and ſo will his precious Blood be drink really and ſpiritually alſo: but, the manner of eating and drinking there is ſuch a Myſtery, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be known, and may not be ſpoken to. If every Saint can ſay, How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte; yea, ſweeter than Honey to my mouth? If the word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſo ſweet to a Chriſtian ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; How ſweet will the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> be to ſuch an one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51635:38"/> when glorified? How ſweet are the fruits of holineſs and righteouſneſs to a true believer, who ſits under <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Tree of Life with great delight? How ſweet, I ſay, is his fruit to his taſte in the way of an Ordnance? but, to him that overcometh, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God; which, whoſoever eats of, ſhall live for ever. To taſte that the Lord is gracious here, is good; to taſte that the Lord is glorious will be beſt. The glory of the Body is but the Body of Glory, for our vile Bodies to be changed, that they may be faſhioned like unto <hi>Chriſts</hi> glorious Body; What a high expreſſion of glory is this? When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Transfigured in the Mount, his face did ſhine as the Sun; and when he revealed himſelf to St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> from the excellent Glory, his Body was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a Garment down to the foot, and his Paps girt about with a Golden Girdle, his head and his hairs were white like Wool, as white as Snow; and his Eyes were as flames of Fire, and his Feet like unto fine Braſs, as if they burned in a Furnace, and his voice as the ſound of many Waters; and his Countenance was as the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength: ſo ſhall the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but, the glory wherewith the Soul will be filled will be much more glorious, by how much the Soul excels the Body: The glory of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Next to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, adoring, loving, reverencing, praiſing, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and glorifying the Name of God, they will have each others Name in great veneration; they will have a Name given them, even an everlaſting Name, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than of Sons and Daughters, which cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. He that hath a Name above every Name that is named, not only in this World, but alſo in that which is to come, and gives them high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Names, will preſerve them ſo through all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: If they are notwithſtanding bleſſed, when Men ſhall hate them, and ſeparate them from their company, and reproach, and caſt out their Name as evil; If they then are to rejoyce, and leap for Joy, for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51635:40"/> behold their reward is great in Heaven; How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will they be, when they ſhall never hate, or be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more, nor ever be ſeparated from the Company and Communion of ſo bleſſed a Society as is in Heaven; nor reproach, or be reproached; nor their Names caſt out as evil; nor ever be guilty of reflecting the leaſt diſhonor upon one another. There will be nothing here to obſtruct the fulleſt enjoyment of the fulleſt delight, their delight will be in the Lord, and he will be ever giving them the deſires of their hearts; they ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his Houſe, and he will make them drink of the Rivers of his pleaſures; For, with God, is the fountain of Life: In his light ſhall they ſee light. The pleaſure of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Light, of handling the word of Life, and of living in the Love of God, will yield everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to the glorified. Light and Life, and Love, are things ſo glorious, that the Eſſence of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by them. God is Light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all. The Son of God, even his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the true God, and eternal Life. God is Love, and he that dwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leth in Love dwelleth in God, and God in him. He that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love. For Saints to be clothed with Light, as with a Garment, and to live in and with that Light, to which the Sun being compared, is darkneſs; How pleaſant and pleaſing will it be, both to the bodily and intellectual eye: Never will any eye be ſatisfied with ſeeing, till God who is Light be ſeen. The pure in heart are bleſſed in ſeeing God; the everlaſting loſs of the Beatifical Viſion, and fruition of God, will be the Hell of the ungodly. The pain of ſenſe will eaſilier be born than the pain of loſs. The Viſion of God is the Heaven of the Godly. O it is a bleſſed ſight to ſee God, and to be ſeen of him; If a glympſe here
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51635:40"/> of his glorious Majeſty be ſo joyous; How glorious will a full and fixed ſight of him be in Heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? May I be blind to all the glory in this World, ſo I may live in a believing foreſight, and lively hope of beholding that inacceſſible Light, which is too glorious for Angels to behold, without covering their faces. This Light is Life it ſelf, the original of life to all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Nature, Grace, or Glory: God, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſaid to be the true and Living God, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to falſe and dead Idols: Life is his being, he is becauſe he Lives; and, our Life is hid with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in God, even that of Nature, of Grace, and of Glory; in him we Live, and Move, and have our Being: Life in it ſelf is a happineſs. O how precious a thing is Life! Skin for skin, and all that a Man hath will he give for his Life. The Life of a Fly hath been thought to be more worth than the World; The Life of a Man, doubtleſs, is more worth, than many Worlds which are without Life: but, it is the Life of Grace which makes the Life of Man his comfort; and the Life of ſin to be a Living Death to him: But, the Life of Glory, which is ever to be glorifying and enjoying God, is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Life. To live with Life it ſelf, and for Life it ſelf to live in us; How infinitely ſatisfying will it be to them who are glorified? That we ſhall be ever with this Lord of Life and Glory, is the moſt comfortable word in all the Scriptures: If any Man ſerve me, ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where I am there ſhall alſo my ſervant be. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me. The preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes Heaven. It is our Life eternal to live with him who is Life eternal; and, to live to him; for none of us in Heaven liveth to himſelf; we live there wholly unto the Lord. His Glory there is as truly our end,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51635:41"/> as it is here, he will give to every one glory enough; but he will not give his glory to another: None muſt glorifie himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, will be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Ditty and Duty. Now unto God and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be glory for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created. The main end of our Election, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, Redemption, Juſtification, Adoption, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, Sanctification, Preſervation, and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to glorifie God in our Bodies, and in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are Gods: Our vile Bodies are faſhioned like unto <hi>Chriſts</hi> glorious Body; ſo are our Souls trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, renewed, ſanctified, and cleanſed with the waſhing of Water, by the Word, that they might be preſented to God himſelf, glorious, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love, to the Praiſe of the glory of his Grace. God is Love as well as Life; the Life which he lives, is a life alſo of Love: What lovely living will it be in Heaven to live with love it ſelf? To love, and be beloved by God, who is Love, will be the Saints everlaſting happineſs: God will for ever be in love with all the Glorified An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints; and they again will for ever be in love with him I Love them that Love me, ſaith God; not only God Eſſentially, but God Perſonally is Love: The Father is love, the Son is love, the Holy Ghoſt is love. The knowledge we ſhall have of the Trinity loving each other, with the love of Unity in an infinite manner, and meaſure, will very much contribute to our heavenly happineſs. If the Union, Communion, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51635:41"/> Communication of Love, between Husband and Wife, be ſo great a Myſtery; How much greater a Myſtery is that, which is between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church?</hi> But, O how myſterious a ſecret are the Tranſactions of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>to the World, that we might live through him: herein is love, that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins. I ſay, if God ſo loved the World, What manner of Love hath he beſtowed upon his only begotten Son? The Father loveth the Son, and the Son loveth the Father, and the Holy Spirit loveth both the Father and the Son; and the Holy Ghoſt is loved of the Father and the Son; and in their mutual loving and glorifying each other, as they were happy infinitely from Everlaſting, ſo they would have been to everlaſting, though all perſons and things had never been created. Gods eſſential glory is neither capable of addition, or diminution, by reaſon of its infinite perfection. God is not the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for Angels, or Men; he needs neither their love or ſervice; but there is no being happy for any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſave in the full enjoyment of God, and his loving favour through all Eternity: his loving kindneſs is life eternal. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us; he loved us from all Eternity; So God loved the World, and by ſo doing, hath engaged himſelf to love us to eternity; whom he loves, he loves to the end: That which makes his love altogether lovely, is, That he ſet his love upon us, becauſe he loved us; no Merit or Motive in us why he ſhould love us: there were Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Merits indeed why he ſhould not love us; when, by wilful ſin, we had caſt away the Mercies of our Creation, he might have caſt us off, and caſt us out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51635:42"/> to the loathing of our perſons; In the day we were born, and lay polluted in our blood, then he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and behold this time was the time of love; he then ſaid unto us, when we were in our Blood, Live. His Love was our Life. If God loved us ſo, when we were ſinful, What manner of Love will he beſtow upon us when ſinleſs? Our ſin Original and Actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitates us to receive the Mercies, and enjoy the Love, the Lord would willingly vouchſafe us: But, in Heaven, we ſhall be able, and perfectly capable, and God infinitely willing to load us with all his Benefits; God will never be weary of giving out his Loves, nor we unwilling or weary in a Joyful and Thankful receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and returning the ſame to our beſt Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. It will be love of the neareſt union, the higheſt, and holieſt Communion, and the freeſt and fulleſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. The glory which the Father gave unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he hath given to Chriſtians, that they may be one in glory, even as the Father and the Son are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one. A Myſtery that cannot be ſeen otherwiſe than by the light of glory. From this moſt intimate union, there doth ariſe ſuch a Communion between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and the Triumphant Chriſtian Church, as will yield infinite and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſatisfaction; much of this Communion will be a mutual Commendation: Behold thou art fair, my Beloved, behold thou art fair; behold thou art fair my Love, yea pleaſant! thou art all fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Love, there is no ſpot in thee, ſaith <hi>Christ</hi> of his Church Militant. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> preſents to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh: there will be no want of expreſſions, for commendation of her; nor will the Triumphant Church want triumphing matter,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51635:42"/> and words to ſet forth the Praiſes of her, altogether Lovely, and dearly Beloved Head and Husband; when he comes to be glorified in his Saints, he will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in and by all them that believe: then will the Name of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be glorified in us, and we in him, according to the Grace of our God, and the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he will rejoyce over us with Joy; he will reſt in his Love; he will joy over us with ſinging when his Glory ſhall be revealed, that we may be glad alſo with exceeding Joy. When <hi>Solomon</hi> was anointed King, the People rejoyced with great Joy, ſo that the Earth rent with the ſound of them: When Saints are Anointed Kings, by the King of Kings, What ſhouting for Joy then will there be in Heaven? There is Joy in the preſence of the Angels of God, over one ſinner that repenteth. When all Sinners, by Repentance, have commenced Saints in Glory; then, not only the Angels of God, but the God of Angels will rejoyce over them with Joy unconceivable and full of Glory: Then will God ſupply all their needs according to his riches in Glory, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the riches of the glory of the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which now are unſearchable, will then be laid open: The Lord ſhall open unto his Heavenly Family his good Treaſure, where every one ſhall have full and free liberty to take his everlaſting portion of glory; not for himſelf only, but for the Community: the glorified have a partnerſhip in each others happineſs. Every one in Heaven hath a full view of, a ſhare in, and a right unto, the glory of every bleſſed Angel and Saint, which greatly adds to their glory, therefore it is ſuch a weight of glory.

We loſt not only our ſelves, but all our right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. By the grace of Redemption our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath recovered this forfeited Glory. That Kingdom and Glory which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed, God hath promiſed to the Poor in this World, whom God hath choſen, rich in Faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him; and, becauſe he is faithful that promiſed, this Kingdom is preſerved, which is an Inheritance In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51635:43"/> and Undefiled, and that ſadeth not away; reſerved in Heaven for them who are the called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his purpoſe; even the purpoſe of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Election; not of Works, but of him that calleth; for, as there is a Kingdom purpoſed, ſo are there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are purpoſed to this Kingdom, and prepared to it; that he might make known the riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the veſſels of Mercy, which he hath afore prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto Glory, even a pecu iar or purchaſed People; the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood: for we were not redeemed with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that we might be the heirs of the Promiſe of the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him; who are kept by the power of God, through Faith, unto Salvation: for, as there is an Inheritance in Heaven, reſerved for all that are called according to purpoſe, prepared, purchaſed, and Children of the Promiſe; and, if Children, then Heirs, and Joynt-heirs with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Kingdom of Glory; ſo theſe are kept, by him that is able, from falling, and preſented faultleſs before the preſence of his Glory, with exceeding Joy: Theſe are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unto whom it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and to enjoy the Mercies, Graces, Comforts, and the glorious Priviledges thereof, both for time and eternity. Thus have I, through the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit, in ſome meaſure opened the Myſteries and Treaſures of the Kingdom of God; which, as it is a Kingdom of Grace, ſo alſo a Kingdom of Glory; having finiſhed the Doctrinal part, the Application followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Information of the Neceſſity, Excellency, and Utility of the Chriſtian Religion. There is an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51635:44"/> abſolute and infinite neceſſity, that every one ſhould profeſs and practiſe the true Religion in the Doctrine and Duties of it, which are according unto Godlineſs, for the attainment of Grace and Glory; which, in conjunction with the Glory of God, is the one thing neceſſary. Such a thing there is, as Pure Religion and undefiled, whereby we bind our ſelves in a Solemn Covenant, to be what God would have us to be; and, to do, what God would have us to do, upon which our endleſs ſtate depends: and therefore to be really Religious, which is a living to God, is no indifferent thing; becauſe the inviſible things of eternity, which Religion is concerned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout, are the greateſt realities, and of the greateſt moment to every Immortal Soul, which is capable of being unſpeakably happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in Heaven or Hell through all Eternity. God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Grace, and Glory muſt be had, there is no living or dying in Peace without them. Behold, now is the accepted time, to accept them, and to be accepted! Behold, now is the day of Salvation! which if it be neglected, an eternal night of Damnation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an excellency in Religion, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in being converſant about matters of ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent worth and weight; as namely, the glorifying of God in wayes of Grace and Glory: upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therefore it is, the Righteous is more excellent then his Neighbor. Religion is for Godlineſs which is profitable to all perſons, and things; having promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. Happy is the Man that in the way of Religion getteth Godlineſs, for the Merchandiſe of it is better, than the Merchandiſe of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold; ſhe is more precious than Rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51635:44"/> her; Length of dayes is in her Right hand, and in her Left hand Riches and Honor; her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine of the Kingdom of Grace and Glory ſpeaks doleful and dreadful Tidings to the wicked and ungodly. The unrighteous ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. No Whoremonger, nor Unclean Perſon, nor Covetous Man, who is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of God. Let no Man therefore deceive himſelf with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of Diſobedience; the loſs of this Kingdom will be more intollerable to the Wicked, than the enduring of the eternal torments of Hell, becauſe the loſs is infinite; God is loſt, and the Eternal weight of Glory is loſt. The pains of Hell are after a ſort finite, though infinite in duration; and between finite miſery, and infinite glory, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite inequality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be a Kingdom of Grace and Glory, Are not they then beſides themſelves, that think and ſay, That a holy diligence, and ſtrictneſs in Religion, and the Duties thereof, in order to its attainment, is more ado then needs; that practically ſay, It is vain to ſerve God: and, What profit is it that we have kept his Ordinance? and, Behold! What a wearineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with him, and ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glory, and ſhall gather before him all Nations, and ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oats, and ſhall ſet the Sheep on his Right hand, but the Goats in the Left; when the King ſhall ſay unto them on his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51635:45"/> Right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World: When he ſhall ſay alſo unto them on his Left hand, Depart from me ye Curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: When the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power; when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reckon with his Servants about the improvement of their time and talents, for we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad; and ſhall ſay, Well done thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord: and when he ſhall ſay to him that received one Talent and hid it in the earth; Take the Talent from him, and caſt ye that wicked, ſlothful and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth: then will the holy diligence of the Saints and Servants of the Lord be juſtified; and the minds of them that judged diligent Godlineſs to be more ado than needed, will be otherwiſe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wiſh, too late, they had been wiſe and faithful; that by their Lord, at his coming, they might have been found ſo doing, as thoſe that were faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, and receive the Crown of Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there is a Kingdom of Grace and Glory, ſpeaks the dignity and happineſs of the Saints; Let
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51635:45"/> their condition in this World, as to the things of the World, be never ſo bad; be they poor and perſecuted, having nothing, they poſſeſs all things; things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, Spiritual, and Eternal are their right; all things are yours, ſaith the Apoſtle: Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the World, or Life, or Death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours; and, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is yours: he that hath <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath all things. He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; How ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things. They who have a true intereſt in God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Grace and Glory, cannot want for real Treaſures, Honors and Pleaſures, either in this, or the better World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That there is a Kingdom of Grace and Glory, ſpeaks alſo the great love of God, wherewith he hath loved us, and the exceeding riches of his Grace; That God of his free Mercy towards us in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſhould take any of us out of the ſtate of Nature, Sin, and Miſery, to reinſtate us into his Grace and Favour; That from the preſence of his Grace he might tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate us into the preſence and Kingdom of his Glory: What manner of love hath God the Father beſtowed upon us? God ſo loved the World, that he ſent his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son into i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Uſe is for trial and examination of our ſelves, as to our right and title to glory. The laſt Article in our Chriſtian belief, is the Life everlaſting, which every one will ſay he believes, That there is a Kingdom of Glory, is without controverſie.

And, we may further know our Title to this Kingdom, if we are willing to go, if I may ſo ſay, to the price of it; though it be purchaſed for us, and we purchaſed to it; for, we are bought with a price.

Something <hi>Chriſt</hi> expects we ſhould part with; and ſomething we are to do and ſuffer, before he give us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: We are to buy the Truth; but, not to ſell it.

If we can prove our Regeneration, we may certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Eternal Salvation. All the graces of the holy Spirit conſtitute the Divine Nature, which is conveyed by the Holy Ghoſt in the way of Regeneration or the New-birth; now Regeneration, or the New-birth, is a very great ſecret, and can be known no other way by us, but by the ſeveral graces of the Spirit, and their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations upon the whole Man, and influences into the Converſation, to diſcourſe at large of every grace: And, how we may know we have them in truth, I leave to a better opportunity; at preſent theſe three, namely, Faith, Love, and New Obedience; may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

Faith is the firſt Life of Grace; it knits and unites us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is our life: It is out of his fulneſs that we receive by Faith, and grace for grace. It is that grace by which we behold, with open face, as in a Glaſs, the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image, from glory unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord. They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of the Son of God, may know that they have Eternal Life, becauſe that they believe on the Name of the Son of God; Now he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf, the witneſs of God; for this is the witneſs of God, that he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life; and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son; and this is the Record, That God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son; and he that hath, believeth or receiveth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life: ſo that our Eternal Life depends upon our faith or faithfulneſs in believing; that is, in the truth of our aſſent to the truth of the whole Word of God, only upon the authority of Gods ſpeaking it; eſpecially in believing or aſſenting to this faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is worthy of all acceptation, That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came into the World to ſave ſinners; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting unfeignedly to have him for our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; truſting only upon the Merit of his death upon the Croſs; his Reſurrection and Interceſſion for our acceptance with God; our Juſtification an Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; committing our ſelves, and all our concernments wholly to his guidance and government; cal ing all our care and burdens upon him, as iudging him to be

God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son; In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him, herein is love. This love breeds love; Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another; much more ought we to love God; and indeed, if we do ſoundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this love of God towards us, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we ſhall anſwer this love with love again; In loving God above all, even with all the heart, with all the Soul, and with all the ſtrength, and with all the mind; for he that loveth Father, or Mother, more than God, is not worthy of him; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than God, is not worthy of him; and then love we him indeed, when we love whom he loves, and what he loves, and hate what he hates.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God; he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love: In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World. Herein is love, beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought to love one another with a love of Union, Complacency and Benevolence, being of one Mind, Will, Way, about one Work: God-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, Delighting in each others Perſons, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Communication; Like <hi>David,</hi> the Saints were all his delight: as we have opportunity, doing good to all, but eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith; for to do good and Communicate, is a Sacrifice God is well pleaſed with; but, whoſo hath this Worlds good, and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Compaſſion from him; How dwelleth the love of God in him? the love of God dwelleth not in him at all, nor doth he dwell in God; for he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in God, dwelleth in love, and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in God, ſhall never dwell with him: But he who loves God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> truly, loves all Saints, as God loves them, with a ſpecial love; and, as God loves all Saints, ſo he loves them alwayes, even to the end: ſo do all true lovers of God, and his Saints; as they love them all, ſo they love them alwayes; even to the end. If we thus love the Brethren, we may know that we are paſſed from death unto life. Our love muſt extend to enemies, even the worſt of our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51635:51"/> enemies; though we cannot love them with a love of Union and Complacency, we muſt love them with a love of Benevolence, becauſe it is a Goſpel-Command, and therefore a Goſpel-Duty, to love our enemies, and do good to them that hate us; If we only love them that love us, What do we more than others? but, if we love them that hate us, we do more than others; then are we the children of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are merciful as he is merciful, and perfect as he is perfect: And if we love not our enemies, we are enemies to our enemies, Gods enemies, and our own. To love heartily a profeſſed practical enemy, is a greater duty, and difficulty, than moſt profeſſors are aware of; How far are they from loving their enemies that do not love their brethren? and, without loving of their brethren, and our enemies alſo, and doing good to them that hate us, there is no going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: as we muſt love whom God loves, ſo what God loves; his Word, Works, Wayes, Righteouſneſs, his Ordinances and Sanctuary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God loves the Gates of <hi>Sion.</hi> O how I love thy Law, and I have loved the habitation of thy Houſe, and the place where thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor dwelleth, ſaith every one that is godly: As we muſt love what God loves, ſo muſt we hate what God hates, and as God hates; now God hates ſin with a perfect hatred, ſo muſt every one that loves the Lord, hate ſin and wickedneſs with a perfect hatred: Ye that love the Lord hate evil, becauſe he hates it; we cannot but ſin while ſin dwelleth in us; but, when it is acted it muſt be hated, and is hated by every one that is godly; What I hate, that do I, ſaith St. <hi>Paul:</hi> We muſt ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If I can ſay, I am my Beloveds, I may be ſure that my Beloved is mine: Nothing makes perſons ſo perfectly one, as perfect love; which is not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed, and in Truth. A love to the Perſon beloved, above the Portion enjoyed; a love to every one, and every thing the party beloved hath a kindneſs for; and a hatred of averſion, diſplicency, and abhorrence of that which is contrary to love, and the perſon beloved. By this alſo we may know that we love God, and the children of God, when we keep his Commandments, for this is the love of God that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; and hereby we do know that we know him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and love him, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the word of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him: as our love to God is a ſign of his love to us, ſo the keeping of his Commandments is an evidence of the truth of our love to him; according to our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Queſtion to <hi>Peter,</hi> three times, Loveſt thou me more than theſe? Loveſt thou me? Loveſt thou me? Thou knoweſt that I love thee, ſaith he; How? Feed my Lambs, feed my Sheep: Do you think <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have believed <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> believed himſelf, touching his love, if he had diſobeyed this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51635:52"/> Commandment? <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to all, If ye love me keep my Commandments; and he that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: Now the Commandments of God are both Moral and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; Moral, contained in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Ten Words, called the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, called the Law or Doctrine of Faith, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salvation of Mankind by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> come already in the fleſh, to be believed by all that will be ſaved, neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any one doth, Oh! that every one would, ask this ſerious queſtion ſeriouſly, What muſt I do to be ſaved? the only anſwer to it, is, Believe on the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and thou ſhalt be ſaved. This is his Commandment, That we ſhould believe on the name of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and love one another, as he gave us Commandment. There is a Law of Love as well as of Faith; Love is the ſum of the Law, and hath the Power and force of a Law in it: All the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, <hi>Love.</hi> To God above all. Love thy Neighbor as thy ſelf. If there be any other Commandment, it is briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this ſaying, namely, Love to God, and our Neighbor: Love worketh none ill to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law: As love is the Fulfilling of the Law, ſo ſin is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God. The Moral and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Law is againſt ſin. Sin not; ſtand in awe and ſin not, is one great Command from God, which we muſt live in continual obedience unto: Our great fear, deſire, care, and endeavour, muſt run out this way, that we ſin not. Sin is the chiefeſt evil, as it oppoſeth God the chiefeſt good; therefore we are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51635:52"/> commanded to abhor that which is evil, and abſtain from all appearance of evil; If we will enter into life, we muſt keep this Commandment, no entering into Heaven with Sin: There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abomination, or maketh a lye; For, God hath no pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him. Sin and Sinners muſt be turned into Hell for ever. The wages of ſin is death: we muſt be ſaved from ſin, before we can be ſaved from Hell. Let us try what Conſcience we make of this Command; Do we fear to ſin? Can we ſay we fear none but God, and nothing but Sin? he that feareth the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be rewarded. Do we live in no known ſin, either of Heart or Life; of Omiſſion, or Commiſſion? When we are overtaken with ſin, are we ſorry for it after a godly ſort, until, by an humble confeſſing, and an hearty forſaking it, we are reconciled to God? If we be unreconciled to ſin in our hearts, and to a way and courſe of ſin in our life, we may be ſure God and we are reconciled. When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life. Our Eternal State may be known by our diſpoſitions and converſations towards ſin: as the very bent and by-aſs of our hearts and lives are for, or againſt ſin, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually and practically, ſo will God determine our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal condition for Heaven or Hell: In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil. Whoſoever abideth in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſinneth not: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſinneth hath not ſeen him, neither known him. Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. Yet is there a truth in this, if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us; if we ſay we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51635:53"/> have not ſinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us: but he that committeth ſin, is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother, which is a Damnable ſin; for he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abideth in Death; and not to love, and to hate, in Scripture, is of the ſame ſignification. Whoſoever hateth his brother is a Murderer: and, ye know, that no Murderer hath Eternal Life abiding in him: He that loveth not his Brother, hath neither Spiritual Light, Life, or Love in him. He that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe that darkneſs hath blinded his eyes. This ſin of not loving, or hating a Brother, is darkneſs that ſo blindeth the eyes, that whoſoever is guilty of it, is under this Judgment, he knoweth not whither he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I doubt not but everyone that loveth not his Brother, thinks he doth love him, becauſe he loves him in Word, and in Tongue, and thinks he ſhall go to Heaven. Alaſs, What doth it profit, if a brother or ſiſter be naked, or in priſon, and deſtitute of daily food, and one ſay unto them, depart in peace; be you warmed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is he not in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, unto outer darkneſs? if he that hateth his Brother, ſay, I love God, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ſeen; How can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? There is a wide difference between the godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly's ſinning: It is too true that both of them ſin. The godly Mans purpoſe, promiſe, and practiſe, is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually and ordinarily againſt all ſin. The wicked Mans Trade, Cuſtom, Conſcience, Work and Way is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51635:53"/> ſin; he is known to be wicked, by being a worker of Iniquity; he lives in ſin; in a ſtate of ſin; in the practiſe both of ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, which they who are Godly doe not, dare not do; they alſo do no Iniquity: the tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith, That there is no fear of God before his eyes; they that fear not God, fear not to ſin; by the fear of the Lord Men depart from evil. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil. The Lord hath ſet apart him that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelf, to ſtand in awe that he ſin not. Every godly man is negatively and poſitively holy, in heart, ſpeech, and behaviour. His Prayer is his Practiſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline not my heart to any evil thing, to practiſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works with men that work iniquity. I have incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mine heart to perform thy Statutes alway, even unto the end. No corrupt communication proceedeth out of his Mouth, but that which is good, to the uſe of edifying: he ſpeaketh the truth in his heart; his ſpeech is alwayes with grace, ſeaſoned with ſalt, ſound, that cannot be condemned. The mouth of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeaketh Wiſdom, his Tongue talketh of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: his Tongue is his glory, ſo called in Scripture, and uſed only for Gods Glory; with it he Prayes to, and Praiſes God. The high Praiſes of God is in his mouth; Prayer and Praiſe, with heart and voice, is a good Mans daily practice. He walks uprightly; that is, he walks not after the Fleſh, in the luſt of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; he makes, he takes no proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie it in the luſts thereof: In rioting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, in chambering and wantonneſs, in ſtrife and envying; all bitterneſs and wrath, and anger and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and evil ſpeaking he puts away from him, with all malice; yea, all that is in the World, the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of heart and life: Whatever elſe God forbids, he forſakes;

Since the beginning of the World, Men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for them that wait for the hour which is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear the voice of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the Reſurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damnation. I have been the longer upon this uſe of Examination, as being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greateſt moment not to be deceived in: That which is our greateſt concern in this World, next to the glory of God, is to have an aſſured intereſt in the Kingdom of Grace, and alſo a true Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, is the word of Exhortation, which high and low, rich and poor, young and old are to attend unto with all poſſible ſincerity, ſeriouſneſs and diligence. It is the duty and the dignity, from the King upon the Throne, to the Beggar upon the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, to ſeek this Kingdom of Grace and Glory. The greateſt hath as great need to ſeek it, as the meaneſt; all are come ſhort of the glory of this Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51635:59"/> all have ſinned. Our greateſt fear ſhould be, leaſt any of us ſhould ſeem to fall ſhort for ever of ſo glorious a Kingdom; and, our greateſt care, deſire, and endeavor ſhould be, next to the glory of God, to enjoy him in the way of his Grace here, till we arrive at the full viſion and fruition of him in Heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This Kingdom of God is loſt, becauſe we are loſt; it is loſt to us, and we loſt to it: but, not ſo far loſt, but the true ſeekers of it may find it, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be found in the right way of ſeeking it. It muſt be found, otherwiſe the ſeekers of it loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and this Kingdom for ever. Many will ſeek to enter into the Kingdom of Grace and Glory, but ſhall not be able. There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? but few there be that ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and walk in the narrow way which leadeth unto life, and therefore few there be that find it. There is no rational Creature upon the face of the Earth, that is exempted from this duty of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Sinners, as well as Saints, are to hearken unto, and obey the Counſel, Command, and Proclamation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> herein. The chiefeſt ſinner hath a Call and Command to ſeek it, which is his Warrant, and a Promiſe for his incouragement: Ask, and it ſhall be given you; Seek, and ye ſhall find; Knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. The chiefeſt Saint hath no diſpenſation againſt this Duty, Counſel, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but, looking diligently, leſt any Man fail of, or fall from the Grace of God, leaſt any root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſpring up, ſeeing he looks for ſuch great things, is to be diligent, that he may be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs, at his coming; that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is our life ſhall appear, he alſo may appear with him in glory: Sinners, ſuch I mean, as are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51635:59"/> unconverted, and are ſtrangers and enemies to <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Grace and Glory, and their own greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; have moſt need to be exhorted, excited, and perſwaded, to ſeek firſt theſe things, namely, the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs; which can never happily be done, till they be firſt diſſwaded, and prevailed with from ſelf-ſeeking, ſelf-pleaſing, fleſh-pleaſing; for the ſatisfying whereof, earthly things are minded, and ſought after inordinately: and therefore it is the Wiſdom of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades to the ſeeking of Spiritual and Heavenly things, by Reaſons, Arguments, Motives, and Diſſwaſions, to free the Minds, and Hearts, and Affections of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, from their anxious and troubleſome thoughts, fears and cares, concerning carnal and earthly things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Body; namely, what they ſhould eat, what they ſhould drink, and what they ſhould put on. Take no thought for your life; Is not the life more than meat? and, The body than raiment? Your heavenly Father feedeth the Fowls of the air, Are not you much better than they? Why take ye thought for Raiment? conſider the Lilies of the field; if God ſo cloath the Graſs of the Field, Shall he not much more cloath you? therefore take no thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink, or wherewithal ſhall we be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed? for, after all theſe things do the Heathens ſeek: but, let Chriſtians ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, even thoſe things which are above, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſitteth on the right hand of God, and ſet their minds and affections on things above, and not on things on the earth. It is much below every Chriſtian by profeſſion only, ſo to love the World, as to ſeek the things that are in the World; for, all that is in the World, the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51635:60"/> the World; and therefore if any Man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: What <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A lover of, and a liver in pleaſure, can never be a lover of God, nor God a lover of him, nor can he ever be a liver with him while ſuch.

If thou be'ſt wicked, or a fool, which is all one, the Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell thee, Honor is not ſeemly for a fool. To receive honor one of another, and not to ſeek the honor that cometh from God only, is the ſin and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor which every unbeliever is guilty of, and a great let and impediment in the duty of ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God. Seekeſt thou to be rich in this World? labor not to be rich: yet, if Riches increaſe, ſet not thine heart upon them.

It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for ſuch a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God: What is a Man profited if he ſhall gain the whole World, with all its honors, pleaſures, and riches, and loſe his own Soul, and his portion of grace and glory? or, What ſhall a Man give or take in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul? Is not the Redemption of the Soul precious? It was not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World. God never intended the whole World to be the portion of every Man; God only is Mans Portion, and Man is Gods portion: Why ſhould any Man then wrong that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part within him, his Soul; as to ſeek, purſue, and follow after ſuch beggarly things, as Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and Pleaſures, and take up with them as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope and happineſs, which every wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doth; the mean while neglecting, and making light of the one thing neceſſary; ſeeking to enjoy God, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Grace, and Glory; in whom, and from whom alone they may infallibly have the true, durable, unſearchable, ſatisfying, everlaſting riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and pleaſures. Oh! did but the great ones of this World conſider, and know what deceitful baits,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51635:61"/> ſnares, and temptations, theſe worldly dignities, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and treaſures, through Gods permiſſive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Satans Subtilties, prove to their luſtful and deceitful hearts; Would they ſo eagerly hunt after them, and undo their Bodies and Souls in the purſuit of them? True, there is no evil in them, but, through an evil unbelieving heart, there is much evil by them: Search the Scriptures, and ſee, how many rich, and honorable, and pleaſurable perſons, are gone, or will go to Heaven; not many wiſe men, after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called: God, that hath choſen the poor of this World, rich in faith, hath not choſen the rich in this World to be poor in faith: There is a ſore evil under the Sun, namely Riches, kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. Did the Rich in this World, in Scripture called the Men of the World, which have their portion in this life, well conſider, how little their Riches will profit them in the day of wrath; they would not be ſo high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, who giveth them richly all things to enjoy; they would do good, be rich in good Works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, that they may lay up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life, which is the worſt I wiſh them; and, the beſt uſe they can put their uncertain riches unto. Oh! How many are, and will be, undone for ever, by a deceitful World, a deceitful Devil, and a deceitful heart, from which I beſeech the Lord to deliver our moſt Gracious Soveraign the King and his Kingdom; that we may all, as one Man, with oneneſs and trueneſs of heart, ſet our ſelves, according to our Solemn Engagement in our Chriſtian Covenant, unfeignedly to renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, which muſt firſt be

The Members of the Body muſt be alſo Inſtruments herein; the ſtrength of the inward and outward Man is to be put forth, our Natural ſtrength, our Spiritual ſtrength, all the power we have, and can get from God: We had need to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and to Pray, That he would grant us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Riches of his Glory, even his glorious Power, to be ſtrengthened with all might, by his Spirit in the inner-man; ſince we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood only, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places. We have three potent enemies to out-wreſtle, the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, all combined againſt us; we have God to wreſtle with by Prayer, and all other holy means for the obtaining of Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if we be not Conquerors, through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, we loſe, not only the prize of an incorruptible Crown, but, by our unfaithfulneſs and cowardize, bring upon our ſelves an infinite weight of Judgment.

Wherefore, let us gird up the Loyns of our Minds, and be ſober, and hope to the end, for the Grace and Glory that is brought unto us, at the Revelation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Life and Death E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal are ſet before us, let us chooſe Life, and cleave to him in our Wills, who is our Life; Let our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be ſet on things above; Let our Converſation be in Heaven; that our Commoration and Everlaſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode may be there alſo; This is to ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God with all our heart, and with all our might.

This is the Sin that ſhutteth ſo many out of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51635:65"/> Heaven, and ſhutteth up as many into Hell; he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. True believers are the only true ſeekers of the Kingdom of God, and will be the only enjoyers of it. Oh were our Faith as reall, as this Kingdom is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial! What manner of ſeekers would all of us be? It is not heartily believed, and therefore not heartily ſought after: were it ſought believingly, it would be ſought faithfully. Faith breeds faithfulneſs; they are neer a kin: What is Faithfulneſs, but a fullneſs of Faith, a ſtirring up the work of Faith with power, to receive out of the fullneſs which is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> grace for grace; grace, to exerciſe grace, ſo to walk, even as he walked in faithfulneſs, both to God and Man; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in tranſacting and negotiating the great Work of his Mediatory-Office, in our Redemption, and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtle and High-Prieſt of our Profeſſion, was faithful unto him that appointed him: Such are all true Chriſtians or Saints, called faithful in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> as alſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> faithful in all his houſe; and <hi>Abraham;</hi> they are Stewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom of God: Moreover, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful to God, himſelf, and others; for, as every Man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Gift, even ſo Miniſter the ſame one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. In ſeeking the Kingdom of God, before it can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there is much doing and ſuffering-work to be performed, which requires much faithfulneſs: he only is the wiſe and faithful Servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh to take an account of his Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is found ſo doing; as the Servant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God from the heart; not following that which is evil, but that which is good: He that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51635:65"/> doth good is of God, but he that doth evil hath not ſeen God. Hypocrites ſay, but do not: but, a doer of the Work, this Man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed, or doing. What St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Gaius,</hi> beloved, thou doeſt faithfully; whatſoever thou doeſt to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to ſtrangers, ought to be verifyed of every one who ſeeks the Kingdom of God. Seek faithfully; do all that is to be done for the obtaining it, by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent continuance in well-doing, and faithful alſo in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for righteouſneſs ſake, we muſt, through much tribulation, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; think it not ſtrange therefore, concerning the fiery Trial, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you; but rejoyce, yea, count it all joy, when ye fall into divers Temptations, inasmuch as ye are partakers of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings; that when his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding Joy, for great is your reward in Heaven, being heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together; wherefore, let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, in ſeeking the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator; ſince God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are faithful; his Word faithful, Miniſters faithful; for ſo we are to account them, being the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful. Since it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that there is a Kingdom of Grace and Glory; whatever we do or ſuffer, in order to the enjoying of it, let it be done in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart. So alſo diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe things which are excellent, are difficult, and hard to come by, ſuch are Spiritual and Heavenly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51635:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> things; namely, Grace and Glory, which are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and therefore not ſo eaſily attained. The great and difficult Work that lies upon our hands, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our calling and election ſure; for this end, every one hath, or ſhould have, a particular and general cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to work in both, to keep him from Idleneſs, and to put him upon duty and diligence. Each calling requires much labor and diligence. It is the will of God that none ſhould ſtand idle. This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, That if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat. It is not only the Character of a good Huſwife, but of a good Chriſtian, that ſhe eateth not the bread of idleneſs. It is not for Men and Women, who have Souls to ſave or loſe, a Heaven or Hell to live in for ever, to live a moment idle: Time, which is for Eternity, is too precious a thing to be Idled away, to be ſpent in any thing, but diligent ſeeking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. What is the Proclamation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but, Hearken diligently unto me; and eat ye that which is good. There is Meat for them to eat, even hidden Manna, Angels food, which endureth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto them who labor for it; with this Meat the Soul of the diligent ſhall be made fat: there is nothing to be had but poverty without diligence. He becometh poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand, but the hand of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, with the bleſſing of the Lord, maketh the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo rich, as he addeth no ſorrow with it; while the wicked, who will be rich, pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows. The unſearchable riches of grace, and Treaſures of glory, are gotten in a way of holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: they, who have eſcaped the corruption that is in the World, through luſt, and are made partakers of the Divine Nature, beſides this, are to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to add to their Faith, Vertue, and to Vertue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51635:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> Knowledge, and to Knowledge Temperance, and to Temperance Patience, and to Patience Godlineſs, and to Godlineſs Brotherly Kindneſs, and to Brotherly kindneſs Charity, till they abound in them; for ſo an entrance ſhall be Miniſtred unto them abundantly, into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> If ſo much diligence be required to grow in grace, What diligence is requiſite to the getting of it? If Miniſtring to the Saints be a Work, and labor of love, which none can attain to the full aſſurance of hope, without ſhewing diligence therein unto the end? What Work, and labor, and diligence, will every grace coſt, before it be attained and perfected? This ſhould by no means diſcourage, but quicken us; our labor will not be in vain in the Lord. Let us not be weary in well-doing, for, in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not: If we are at the pains to ſow holineſs in the Seed-time of this life, we ſhall reap happineſs in the harveſt of Eternity; they who labor for reſt, ſhall reſt from their Labor, and their Works ſhall follow them: a Man that is diligent in this Heavenly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of ſeeking the kingdom of God, he ſhall not ſtand before mean Men, he ſhall ſtand before the King of Kings in all his Glory.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom is to be ſought fervently, both in Speech and Spirit; open thy mouth wide, ſaith God, and I will fill it: we muſt cry mightily to God in Prayer for it; the effectual fervent Prayer of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man availeth much; not ſlothful in buſineſs of the greateſt concernment; fervent in ſpirit, ſeeking the Lord; labouring or ſtriving fervently in Prayers; that we may ſtand perfect, and compleat in all the will of God. It is good to be zealouſly affected alwayes in ſo good a thing, as ſeeking the kingdom of God, which muſt be ſought alſo violently: the kingdom of Heaven
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51635:67"/> ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in other caſes is irregular and dangerous, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a way of ſin, when Men do evil with both hands, earneſtly, the times are then evil with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but, their miſchief will return upon their own heads, and their violent dealing will come down upon their own pates; eſpecially upon them that lie in wait for Blood; that hunt every Man his brother with a Net; and upon her that lieth in the Boſom to deceive and deſtroy: the Violent Man, or Man of Violence, is called the Proud, or Evil Man; It is the Violent Man that purpoſeth to overthrow the goings of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, by hiding Snares and Cords, ſpreading Nets, ſetting Gins for him, while evil ſhall hunt the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man to overthrow him. God hath purpoſed to preſerve the upright Man from this Man of violence, though a Brother; for, a Brother offended, eſpecially without cauſe, is harder to be won then a ſtrong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their Contentions are like the Bars of a Caſtle. There is no going to Heaven or Hell without violence; evil Men are more violent in ſerving Sin and Satan, than good Men in ſerving God, which is an aggravation of their Sin; and a very great ſhame it is for ſuch as are bound for ſuch a place as Heaven is, and going to God, ſhould be ſo ſlow and ſlothful in their pace thither, while the ungodly are making ſuch haſt to Hell. Is a corruptible triple Crown of Earthly Honors, Pleaſures and Riches, in the way to Hell, worth ſo much ſtriving and running for? and, Is the Incorruptible, Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Crown of Life, in the way to Heaven, not worth much more? Every one hath a Race to run, a Prize to get, the way to run in is Gods Commandments, the Prize Eternal Life; if thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments. The great duty is, ſo to run as to obtain. In the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, the fighters and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51635:67"/> the Runners, which were violent, painful Exerciſes, were to put forth all their ſtrength; they had therefore their honorable Encouragements to animate them. The Apoſtle alludes to theſe, to put Chriſtians upon the like activity, becauſe they have many Duties to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, which cannot be performed without painfulneſs and violence; but, one moments being in Heaven, will more then recompence all their labor. Let us get our hearts enlarged, that, with holy violence, we may run the wayes of Gods Commandments unto the end, that our reward may be great in the Kingdom of Glory, which we muſt alſo ſeek valiantly. We have violent, valiant, and potent enemies that ſtand in our way to this Kingdom, to withſtand and conquer, before we can enter into it; the Devil and all his Angels, a flattering and a frowning World; and worſe than all theſe, namely, in-dwelling ſin, a home-born enemy, that is more deceitful, and dreadful, than all our other adverſaries, which muſt be mortified before we can be ſaved: We have all Gods holy, juſt, and good Laws to obey, in every thought, word, and work, in the greateſt ſtrictneſs and ſpirituality, which requires much reſolution, and courage in us, to perform alwayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the end: It is therefore very remarkable, that when God enjoyns every one to obſerve, to do according to all the Law, turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, he ſubjoyns this, and repeats it three times, be ſtrong, and very courageous; be ſtrong, and of a good courage; be ſtrong, and of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; to obſerve to do according to all the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out erring on either hand: It is the narrow way of life, that leads to the ſtrait Gate, which, whoſoever walks therein, ſhall enter in thereat. This can never be done without conſtant courage, and fixed reſolution againſt ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, and the lively
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51635:68"/> performance of all holy Duties, the means of getting Grace, and growing therein; which is our power to reſiſt, mortifie, and overcome, what God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, and to do whatſoever he hath commanded us: neceſſary hereunto is the putting on, the keeping on, the daily fighting in the whole Armor of God; which, that it may be done valiantly, and ſucceſsfully, muſt be done in the name and ſtrength of the Captain of our Salvation, the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> this way <hi>David</hi> vanquiſht all his Enemies that compaſſed him about like Bees; the Name of the Lord was the ſtrong Tower he ran into for ſafety; he made the Lord his ſtrength, and he became his Salvation: our ſtrength, valour, and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs is from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which teacheth our hands to War, and our fingers to fight; that we wax valiant in fight, turning to flight the Armies of the Aliens: What is it that a Chriſtian cannot do, through <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening him with all might, by his Spirit in the inner Man. True Believers are the only valiant Men in the World; none have ſo many and great enemies to conteſt with as they: What wonderful exploits did thoſe Worthies in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do, through the power of their Faith? they turned not their back upon the World, the Fleſh, or the Devil; in all theſe things they were more than Conquerors. Tribulation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, perſecution, famine, nakedneſs, peril, ſword, death, life, Angels, principalities, powers, things preſent, things to come, height, depth, nor any other creature, can ſeparate true Believers from the love of God which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> through God they do valiantly, for he it is that ſhall tread down our enemies, that we may paſs in ſeaſon and ſafety, through a Kingdom of Grace to a Kingdom of Glory, which we muſt ſeek vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly; be vig lant, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the Devil walketh about, ſeeking whom he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51635:68"/> may devour; if we be not vigilant as well as valiant, we may eaſily be devoured by Satan; he ſtands Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel night and day, watching that he may recover them, who, by Repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth, through the Mercy and Grace of God, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves out of his ſnares, to take them captive, or alive at his will. When we have ſuch a wakeful, wrathful, watchful, and powerful Tempter ſo nigh us, we had need to watch that we enter not into Temptation. Saints have ſinners their Tempters, and their Enemies every way. O how infinitely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is it, that every Saint ſtand day and night upon his watch; that he watch and keep his heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; that he Pray with <hi>David,</hi> Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips, that I ſin not with my Tongue; that I may keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me; for, the Tongue is ſuch an untameable evil, that if any Man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not in word, the ſame is a perfect Man; ſuch ought all Saints to be, even perfect, having ſo many that watch for Iniquity; that make a Man an offender for a Word; and lay a Snare for him that reproveth in the Gate; and turn aſide the juſt for a thing of nought; and becauſe in wrath they hate them: Caſt Iniquity upon their Names, their Calling <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Perſons, by giving out, or taking up evil Reports againſt them. I heard the Defaming of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, fear on every ſide: Report, ſay they, and we will report it. All my familiars, (everyone of my peace) watched for my halting, ſaying, peradventure he will be enticed, and we ſhall prevail againſt him, and we ſhall take our revenge on him: with ſuch Men have many a poor perſecuted Chriſtian to deal with. Should we not then watch unto Prayer? yea, watching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with all perſeverance; for, he only is bleſſed that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51635:69"/> watcheth, and keepeth himſelf, and his garments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the fleſh, and the World. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God muſt be ſought early, that is, betimes in our age, early, or betime in the morning, which is the meaning of this Word firſt: ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, that is, early; Indeed, all our life-time, how-long-ſoever, is to be employed in ſeeking the glory of God, and glory with God; but, the flower of our age and time is to be ſpent in a more ſpecial manner, in looking after Spiritual and Heavenly things, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſure of them; we have Precepts, Promiſes, and Preſidents, to quicken our endeavors: Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth; they that ſeek me early ſhall find me: <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern herein; when the Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> was Twelve years old, he was found in the Temple ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them queſtions, that all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his Underſtanding and Anſwers, and when they ſaw him they were amazed: His cuſtom was to riſe up a great while before day to Prayer, and after to Preach this kingdom of God; by Prayer he ſought it for us, in his Preaching he offered it to us; to this very day, in the Miniſtery, he is ſeeking firſt the kingdom of God, in a way of Prayer and Preaching for us. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> a Man after <hi>Chriſts</hi> own heart, was at his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion early in the morning; O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee; My voice ſhalt thou hear in the Morning, O Lord; in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up. There is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace and Glory, and few there be that find it: What is the Reaſon? They do not firſt ſeek it; They do not begin when God would have them begin, early, young. Children, under the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, were early dedicated to God, and were under
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51635:69"/> his command, of ſeeking and ſerving him betimes, and commended for ſo doing. Oh that young ones that have no Worldly fears, and cares in their heads and hearts, to trouble and hinder them, would know the time of their Viſitation! their beſt time to acquaint themſelves with God, and to ſeek the things of their everlaſting Peace. How many more might go to Heaven, if they would firſt ſeek the kingdom of God, if they would be every way early at this work, hold on, and hold out to the end ſeeking: Behold! now is the accepted time, even the time of youth; Behold! now is the day of Salvation: Oh the infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that children have for good and godly educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If children now, while children, eſpecially thoſe who are under godly education, be not the children of God; it may be, when they are not children, they ſhall never be the children of God, but the children of his wrath for ever. I am ſure it is the will of God, that children, while they are children, ſhould be his children: <hi>Christ</hi> would have very young ones to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of God; inſomuch, that when the Diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to him, that he ſhould touch them, he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; but then the kingdom of God muſt be ſought primarily, and chiefly; firſt, before other things; firſt, above other things; we are alwayes to begin and end with God, in our ſeeking and ſeeing him, and in ſeeking for our ſelves, Spiritual and Heavenly things are firſt to be deſired, and laboured after; for, we have no command in Scripture to ſeek other things, but a Promiſe, that they ſhall be added, or given in on the by, if we firſt ſeek the kingdom of God, before other things, and above other things, as the principal and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51635:70"/> chief matters of our lives. There is but one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which is, to get well to Heaven: There is but one thing to be deſired and ſought after, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the beauty of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in his kingdom of grace and glory: This is the principal thing, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be regarded. What greater things, wholly to ſwallow up our minds, thoughts, cares, deſires, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, than God, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Grace, and Glory, which are alſo to be ſought with delight and complacency; as the higheſt object of our delight; delight thy ſelf in the Lord, is his Command, and our ſweeteſt Duty. It is not enough to do holy duties, except we delight in them; not for themſelves, but for God, and the things of God, Spiritual and Eternal. Here our delight is to be placed, as ſutable to, and worthy of it; and, all our other delights, in other things, are but to raiſe our delight in God: What poor things are tranſitory ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, pleaſures, and riches, to delight in, that are but for a ſeaſon, in compariſon of thoſe true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durable riches, honors, and pleaſures, which are at Gods right hand for evermore? We may either want thoſe to delight in, or want delight for them, however ſo much as to ſatisfie, they are not Commenſurate and Adequate objects of delight, as being uncertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient; but theſe, which are Spiritual and Eternal, through Gods All-ſufficiency, are both ſure and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which breed ſatisfaction and delight; they that acquaint themſelves with God, are at peace with him, have good from him, receive the Law from his mouth, and delight in it in the inward Man, and lay up his words in their heart; that return to the Almighty, and put away iniquity from their Tabernacles; that have the Almighty for their defence, ſhall alſo have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Almighty; and the Almighty who delights in Mercy, to delight in them. What is it to ſeek the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51635:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> kingdom of God, but to ſeek the greateſt delight? and, Should we not delight in ſeeking delights? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when our ſeeking or praying is Gods delight. The Prayer of the upright is his delight. The kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs are things full of delight. With what delight ſhould we think of them, ſpeak of them, and ſeek them, till we find them, enjoy them, experience, and taſt them? Oh taſt and ſee that the Lord is good! There is more delight and ſweetneſs in taſting and eating of Honey, than in hearing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of its ſweetneſs, and ſeeing it. If there be ſo much ſweetneſs and delight in the word of God, What ſweetneſs then in the Word, that is God? in the multitude of my troublous, ragged thoughts within me, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> thy comforts, or promiſes, delight my Soul: unleſs thy Law had been my delight, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction. The delights that are to be found in God, and in his Law, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſweeten the bittereſt condition: There is much trouble and ſorrow in ſeeking the Kingdom of God, and tribulation to be indured, before it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; but, the delights in the right ſeeking it, and the infinite delights there are to be had in the everlaſting poſſeſſing it, will more than recompence for all the pains and ſufferings: the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us; and therefore this Kingdom of Grace and Glory is to be ſought conſtantly, that is, without ceaſing, day and night, or very frequently, conſtantly, that is, perſeveringly; for God will render to every Man according to his deeds; to them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honor, and Immortality, Eternal Life. Be thou faithful herein, O Chriſtian! unto Death, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give unto thee, in the Kingdom of God, a Crown

Even he that doth ſeek this kingdom of God, which is a kingdom of Grace and Glory, with his whole heart, underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, believingly, faithfully, diligently, fervently, violently, valiantly, vigilantly, early, delightfully, and conſtantly, which is no more than God requires, and the unconceivable excellencies of this kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: Is not the kingdom of Grace it ſelf, nay, one Grace of this kingdom, more worth than all the Glory of all the kingdoms of this World? The very trial of our faith, and ſo of every other Grace, is more precious than Gold that periſheth. How precious is Faith it ſelf? Who that hath the Faith of Gods elect in the leaſt degree in his heart, would part with it at any rate? nothing in this World better than life; skin for skin, and all that a Man hath, will he give for his life: But, How many have loſt their lives to ſave their faith, that they might believe to the ſaving of their Souls; they have died for the Faith, that they might die in Faith: And, as for Hope, which is a patient waiting, and looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the Glorious appearing of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when we ſhall appear with him in Glory, at death; but, more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly at the day of Judgment, when he ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, to be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; who hath this good hope, through Grace, that would part with it for more than all this World, were it Ten thouſand times ten thouſand better than it is?

Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed to themſelves, to their Doctrine, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers, teaching them publickly, and from houſe to houſe, not ceaſing to warn every one night and day with tears, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

If Bonds and Afflictions abide or wait for the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, none of theſe things move them, neither do they count their life dear unto themſelves, ſo that they may finiſh their courſe and their Miniſtry which they have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God; for what is their hope, or joy, or crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing or glorifying; is not the ſound converſion, and ſalvation of their Flock, even in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? Certainly they are their Crown and Joy, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then above all others, ought Miniſters to be, who are workers together with Chriſt, beſeeching one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who preach the Grace of God to others, that we receive not the Grace of God our ſelves in vain, giving no offence in any thing, that our Miniſtry be not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but in all things, without vain-glory, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſs, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, and toſſing to and fro, in labours, in watching, in faſting, by pureneſs, by knowledge, by long-ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the Holy

If the Glory of God indeed, the Salvation of our own Souls, and all theirs commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our charge be our very end, in our patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well-doing, and ſuffering for Conſcience and Righteouſneſs ſake, we are made manifeſt unto God, and may truſt alſo to be made manifeſt in due time in the Conſciences of all; having our ſelves a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that whereas we are ſpoken evil of, as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe our good Converſation in Chriſt; for our rejoycing ſhould be the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the world, and more abundantly to them-ward, who are our care and charge in the Lord. Therefore my beloved Brethren of the Miniſtry, let us be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, and though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be not gathered, and we may ſeem to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain, and ſpent our ſtrength for nought, and

What neceſſity is there alſo that Chriſtians do take heed whom they hear, what they hear, that they hear, and how they hear, that they may not be hearers only, but doers of the work, that they may be bleſſed in their deed. The Apoſtle exhorts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and chargeth every one (as a Father doth his children) that they would walk worthy of God, who hath called them unto his Kingdom and Glory, which is no more than that their Converſation be only as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, putting off concerning the former Converſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts, that their Converſation be without covetouſneſs, and ſo of all other worldly and fleſhly luſts. The luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, with all ungodlineſs, is to be denied; we are not only to abſtain, but to flee from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the Soul, not faſhioning our ſelves according to our former luſts, when we were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We cannot ſerve God and Mammon, their Commands are ſo contrary the one to the other, and therefore to walk worthy of God, is not to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof, it is to wa k honeſtly, or decently, as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying, not in the luſts of concupiſcence, not in the vanity of our mind, in fleſhly wiſdom, not to walk in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeat of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or to walk in any way that is not good, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and eſchew that which is evil, that they may walk with God; to walk with God in the name of the Lord our God, is to walk worthy of God; to walk before him as alwayes in his ſight with a perfect and upright heart, not allowing in our ſelves, or indulging the leaſt ſin, but abſtaini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the Volume of the Book of God, it is written of me, ſaith Chriſt, I delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart. How willingly and patiently did he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51635:79"/> ſuffer for, &amp; from ſinners: O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt. Chriſt came from Heaven on purpoſe to ſuffer in our ſtead, and for our ſakes, according to the Will of God; he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities, the Lord laid on him the Iniquities of us all; he was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet opened not his mouth, he was cut off out of the Land of the Living. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, to put him to Grief, to make his Soul an offering for ſin; that he might pour out his Soul unto death, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. Chriſt alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps; for it is the Will of God that we ſuffer for well-doing, for if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together. Chriſt his active and paſſive obedience for us, and our active and paſſive obedience for him, and for his Glory, is our way to Glory. How patiently did our Lord Jeſus ſuffer from, then when he ſuffered for ſinners; when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly. If when we do well and ſuffer for it, and for Conſcience toward God endure Grief, ſuffering wrongfully, take it patiently, this is thank-worthy, this is acceptable with God: Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his Glory? If we ſuffer, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reign with him; for we are called according to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, through the foreknowledge of God, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be conformed to the Image of his Son in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and that we alſo as he, muſt through much Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation enter into the Kingdom of God; foraſmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh, let us arm
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51635:80"/> our ſelves likewiſe with the ſame mind, by putting off the old man, and putting on the new man; he that hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin, that he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God; let us be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that which is good, who is he then that will harm us? but and if we ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, let us not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled. Let them, as Chriſt Jeſus did, that ſuffer according to the Will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator, which is to walk worthy of God, who hath called us unto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory, and if we be faithful herein unto death, will not be long ere he call us into his Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where we ſhall receive the Crown of Life, but then we muſt walk in the Spirit, and the Spirit will walk in us, which he promiſeth to do, if we keep our ſelves from Idols, come out from among them, and be ſeparated, and touch not the unclean thing; if we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit, we cannot walk worthy of God, his Kingdom, of Grace and Glory, without walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit.

To
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51635:80"/> walk in the Spirit, is to be ſpiritually minded, or of the mind of the Spirit; for as many as are led by the Spirit, or they that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit; now the things of the Spirit are either ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or eternal, Grace or Glory; or what relates to it, which the minds of ſpiritual perſons are taken up with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch are all holy duties commanded by the Spirit, and the fruit of the Spirit, which is in all Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, and Truth, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which conſtitute the divine nature in us, whereby we lead the divine life, which is our walking with God in the Spirit, or glorifying God in our Body and in our Spirit, which are Gods, walk we then in the Spirit, and we ſhall not fulfill the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, nor walk in pride. To walk worthy of God, his Kingdom and Glory, is to walk in wiſdom toward our ſelves; if thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and towards them that are without, and to walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming our time as we have opportunity to do good unto all men, eſpecially labouring to be ſo wiſe, as to win Souls; for they that be wiſe Teachers, turn many to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever, the wiſe ſhall inherit Glory. To walk in Wiſdom, is to underſtand what the Will of the Lord is, and to do thereafter; for a good underſtanding have all they that do his Commandments; it is to underſtand the way wherein we ought to walk, and to walk therein. The Wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way, which is Gods way; this was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath, cauſe me to know the way wherein I ſhould walk, lead me in the way everlaſting: and Gods promiſe, I will inſtruct thee and teach thee in the way
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51635:81"/> which thou ſhalt go, I will guide thee with mine eye, and his performance, he led his people forth by the right way, that they might go to a City of habitation. Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory, ſaith <hi>David:</hi> his practical reſolution, I have choſen the way of Truth; I will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. It is to behave our ſelves wiſely in a perfect way, and to walk within our houſe with a perfect heart. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand alſo the Work of God, his Work of Creation, Redemption, Providence and Grace, and to do with all our might, maugre all oppoſition whatſoever our hand findeth to do, whatſoever Gods Providence layeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to go through with it, conſidering there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom in the Grave, whither we are all going: That we may be alwayes ſo doing, we had need to pray mightily to God, ſo to teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto Wiſdom. The Works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein, they are honourable and glorious, he hath made his wonderful Works to be remembred, known, taken notice of, admired and praiſed; God hath alſo ordained or prepared, that we ſhould walk in good Works, then walk we in Wiſdom indeed, when we are prepared and ready unto, and zealous to maintain every good Work. To walk worthy of God, is to walk in Faith, we walk by Faith, not by ſight, Faith is our ſight, the evidence of things not ſeen, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. To walk in Faith, is to live by the Faith of the Son of God, the life which we now live in the fleſh. It is a continual coming to God, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, till we come to God, a believing that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. It is alſo a daily receiving the Lord Jeſus; and of his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51635:81"/> fulneſs receiving and Grace for Grace, that we ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes or virtues of him who hath called us unto his Kingdom and Glory. To walk worthy of God, is to walk in love, as Chriſt hath alſo loved us; to love God and one another, as Chriſt hath ſet us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and given us a Commandment: This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son, and love one another, as he gave us Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our walking in Faith, is that we might walk in Love, Faith worketh by Love, Faith unfeigned worketh Love without diſſimulation. Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and truth; not a talkative love, but an active, vigorous, faithful, fruitful love, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable both to God and man; even the love that is kind, and thinketh not evil, is not eaſily provoked, like unto Chriſts Love, which he ſhewed evidently in his active and paſſive obedience, doing good to all men, not being weary in well-doing, eſpecially unto them who are of the houſhold of Faith, loving all Saints as Saints, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Chriſt as in his active, ſo in his paſſive obedience, ſuffering with them and for them, with all long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and patience, being their Brethren and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt. Hereby perceive we the Love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren; we love not the Brethren, if we love our Lives better than them. This is Love, that we walk after the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt; they that walk worthy of God, walk in the Wayes of his Commandments, with and before the Lord humbly, obeying from the heart that form of Doctrine which he delivered them, that they may ſerve him thereby in newneſs of Spirit, and in newneſs of Life; they who would enter into Life, muſt thus keep
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51635:82"/> the Commandments; for bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates of the City.</p>
            <p>Is there then a Kingdom of Grace and Glory? Is it purpoſed, prepared, purchaſed, promiſed and reſerved in Heaven for us? Have we a real intereſt in, and a true Title to this Kingdom? O let the high praiſes of God then be in our hearts, in our lips, and in our lives, who hath called us unto this Kingdom and Glory! Let <hi>David</hi>'s reſolution and practice be ours, I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will ſing praiſes unto my God while I have any Being, every day will I bleſs thee, and I will praiſe thy Name for ever and ever. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bleſs his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name; his Heart, and Tongue, and Life were fixed and prepared for this bleſſed Work, called therefore the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> My heart is fixed and prepared, O God my heart is fixed, I will ſing and give praiſe; I will greatly praiſe the Lord with my mouth; he prayes that he may praiſe: O Lord open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe; his whole Life and Converſation nothing elſe but a continual Hymn to God. How fearful was he to ſin; O-let me not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from thy Commandments, refraining his feet from every evil Way, that he might keep the Word of God, hating every falſe Way, rejoycing in the Way of his Teſtimonies, as much as in all Riches; inclining his heart to perform his Statutes alway, even unto the end. Was it <hi>David</hi>'s Duty, Delight, and Work to be ſtill praiſing God, and is it not ours? Have we not, or may we not have as great reaſon and occaſion to bleſs God as he? every one that will may have God and Chriſt, and Grace and Glory, to praiſe and bleſs God for as his portion and happineſs for ever. If every one of us with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51635:82"/> 
               <hi>David</hi> could ſay, Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee. He may alſo ſay when his fleſh and his heart faileth him, God is the ſtrength of his heart, and his portion for ever, which is matter great enough to praiſe the Name of God for with a Song, and magnifie him with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. It is the ſilent Work of all the Works of God to praiſe him paſſively, and the higheſt duty of Saints to bleſs him actively: All thy Works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee. <hi>David</hi> calls upon the whole Creation to pay this homage of praiſe to God as their duty and Gods due: Praiſe ye the Lord from the Heavens, praiſe him all Angels, all Men, Kings of the earth, and all People, Princes, and all Judges of the earth, both young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, Sun, Moon and Stars, Earth, Sea, let them praiſe the Name of the Lord, for his Name alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven, his glorious Name is exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe. O the Treaſures of Excellencies that are in God, in every one of his unſearchable Names, his Word, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, his Works of Creation, Redemption, Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are external; of Election, Predeſtination, Juſtification, Adoption, Regeneration, Sanctification, Conſolation, which are internal, and the everlaſting Kingdom of Glory, matter for eternal prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is unſearchable, ſo are all his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. God is eſpecially to be praiſed in his Sanctuary; every one there, is to ſpeak the praiſes of the glorious honour of his Majeſty, and the glorious Majeſty of his Kingdom. Glorious things are ſpoken of God in his Kingdom of Grace, and more glorious things, here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, are ſpoken in the Kingdom of Glory. Behold now is the accepted time to prepare and tune our hearts,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51635:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> tongues and lives in the Kingdom of Grace, for this Duty and Work of praiſe in the Kingdom of Glory; what is it to glorifie God, but to praiſe him, whoſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth praiſe, and ordereth his Converſation aright, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth him. It is meerly for want of the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified, and our unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with the glorious excellencies of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which is a Kingdom of Grace and Glory, and our intereſt in it, that we ſpeak no more of the glory of this Kingdom, and glorifie God no more by ſpeaking to our ſelves in Pſalms and Hymns, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs, making melody in our hearts unto the Lord, giving Thanks alwayes for all things unto God and the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Were all in theſe Kingdoms Eye-Witneſſes of the Majeſty of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Ear-Witneſſes, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and others were, of his receiving from God the Father honor and glory, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed; I ſay, Were theſe things ever before our eyes, and ever ſounding in our ears, there would certainly be more ſeeking and praying, and praiſing God for this Kingdom of God, which contains all the glory we can poſſibly want, or wiſh, than now there is: Have we not a more ſure Word of Propheſie, whereunto we ſhould all of us do well, that we take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in our hearts. Do we not ſay that the whole Word of God is true? Is there any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly deny a future ſtate of glory? Why do we not all bleſs God for it, till we bleſs God in it? Let every one then that hath underſtanding, ſing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes to our King, ſing praiſes, for God is the King of all the earth, and the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſing we praiſes with underſtanding. Our Tongue in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51635:83"/> Scripture is called our glory; therewith bleſs we God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places, or things in Chriſt, which is the beſt uſe we can put it to. If we be ſtrangers to this heavenly duty of ſinging praiſes to God in our hearts and houſes with our glory, it is much to be feared, that as our chief end is not the glory of God, by our not glorifying God, ſo our laſt end will not be glory with God; without controverſie it is the duty that is moſt pleaſing to God, as it is moſt commanded by him, and practiſed inſtantly by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt Saints. The holier any man is the more in prayer, and the moſt in praiſe; evening and morning, and at noon <hi>David</hi> prayes unto God, ſeven times aday doth he praiſe him. Hypocrites can pray, Saints only do bleſs and praiſe the Lord. The good and old way of ſpeaking to God our ſelves, and one another in Pſalms and ſpiritual Songs, is much given over in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The good Lord give us Repentance, that this ſin be not laid to our charge. We have loſt very much of the ſpecial preſence and providence of God, by our neglect herein; our Prayers are not heard and anſwer'd for want of our ſolemn Praiſes. We obtain mercy by our Prayers, and keep them by our Praiſes. It were well if one in ten with a loud voice glorified God for thoſe daily mercies they receive from God. There are not found that return to give glory to God, after mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received from God, ſave ſome few ſtrangers. What are our hearts and lips, and lives good for elſe, but to warble out in ſpiritual Songs the praiſes of him who hath called us out of marvellous darkneſs, into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light. The glad tydings of a Kingdom of grace and glory, ſhould open our hearts to pray to God to open our lips, that our mouths may ſhew forth his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which that all may do, let the Word of Chriſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51635:84"/> dwell in us richly, in all Wiſdom, teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one another in Pſalms and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging with grace in our hearts to the Lord; and whatſoever we do in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, giving Thanks to God and the Father by him, and above all for himſelf, and the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs. For Counſel and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and I conclude:</p>
            <p>Our honourable Magiſtrates and reverend Miniſters who are taught of God, that are Counſellors themſelves of Peace, and ſeek the Peace and Proſperity of Church and State, I neither need nor dare give them one Word of Advice in this matter; only taking the liberty and boldneſs, by way of Petition, moſt humbly to deſire them who have obtained ſo great mercy to be the heirs of grace and glory, that they would, according to the Power and Prudence, Wiſdom and Goodneſs which God hath graciouſly and liberally given them, improve it to the very utmoſt, that if it were poſſible our moſt gracious and excellent Majeſties Three Kingdoms may become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt; not by Profeſſion only, but in very Deed and in Truth: For the Kingdom of God is not in Word, but in Power, ſince God our Saviour would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can ſwear by no greater, doth ſwear by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way, and live; Turn ye, turn ye from your evil Wayes, for why will ye dye? and now commandeth all men everywhere to repent. Why ſhould not firſt of all Supplications Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all godlineſs and honeſty, which is good and

O could our King and Governors be inſtrumental to bring theſe Kingdoms, ſo to ſeek till they find a Kingdom of grace and glory, what an exceeding eternal weight of glory would the King of glory crown them withall for their labour of Love at the laſt and great day: Hearken to a King ſpeaking from the King of Kings; Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth, ſerve the Lord herein with fear, and rejoyce with trembling. Let the Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together for the Lord, and

Let us exalt the King of Kings upon his holy hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> that the Heathen may be his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth may be his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all Nations whom he hath made may come and worſhip before thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name. Let our moſt excellent King <hi>Solomon</hi> be firſt herein, who is a King of Peace, that came into his Kingdom in Peace, rules in Peace, will dye in Peace, and enter into that Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding: If he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. His eſtabliſhing a great Peace amongſt us, conſtrains me to believe he will be a means of raiſing a holy War through his Kingdoms and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions againſt Sin, Satan, and the World, for the glory of God, and the everlaſting good of many a poor yet precious Soul, ſo that all our contentions and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual devourings ſhall end in a holy, amicable contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly for the Faith of the Goſpel, that we may ſtand faſt in one Spirit, with one mind, and one mouth, glorifying God even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, receiving one another as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of God; than which, what can be more pleaſing to God, honourable to our ſelves, creditable to Religion, profitable and comfortable to His Majeſties Three Kingdoms? If there be joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one Sinner that repenteth, what joy will there be in Heaven over all the Sinners in theſe Kingdoms that repent? The Lord our God in the midſt of us will be mighty to ſave us, he will rejoyce over us with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over us with ſinging, if as Brethren, being called unto liberty, we uſe not our liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another; for all the Law
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51635:85"/> is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf; but if we bite and devour one another, let us take heed that we be not conſumed one of another. And it ſhall come to paſs, that as the Lord rejoyced over us to do us good, ſo the Lord will rejoyce over us to deſtroy us, and bring us to nought; which will aſſuredly come to paſs, if we bleſs our ſelves in our hearts, ſaying, We ſhall have peace, though we walk in the imagination or ſtubbornneſs of our hearts, to add Iniquity to Iniquity, the Lord will not ſpare, but his anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt us, and all the Curſes written in his Book ſhall lie upon us, and he will blot out our names from under Heaven: Curſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is every one that doth the Work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently or deceitfully. But I am perſuaded better Things of you, and Things which accompany Salvation, and that we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of our Souls. Let us take heed, leſt there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God, but exhort one another daily while it is called to day, leſt any of us be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, looking alſo diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble us, and thereby many be defiled; for we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt unto the end, and alſo of his Kingdom of glory, for the ſecuring whereof theſe plain Directions are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to be put in practice.</p>

            <p>They who would ſet themſelves in earneſt to ſeek the Kingdom of God, muſt heartily ſet themſelves againſt all ſins; ſtand in awe and ſin not, while you are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you would find this Kingdom. Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; but then it follows, Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the Unrighteous, who is a man of Iniquity, his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, who will have mercy upon him; but then he muſt have nothing to do with Sin, who will have any thing to do with God and his kingdom, otherwiſe God will have nothing to do with him; the wages of Sin is not Heaven, but hell; every final impenitent, unbelieving Sinner, is to be ſhut out of Heaven, and ſhut up in Hell to all eternity. Sinners, you muſt quit your ſtate, and courſe, and way of ſin, before you can enter the ſtate of Grace, or walk in the way of Life; Grace and Glory are inſeparable, ſo are Sin and Hell. O have nothing to do with any the leaſt, yea, the very appearance of evil, as near as you can, except to hate, abhor, leave and loath it, and your ſelves for it, as ever you hope to ſpeed in this moſt important duty, of ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; more eſpecially, let Unbelief, Pride, Carnality, Covetouſneſs, Lying and Hypocriſie be abandoned and abhorred, as the root and ſource, and ſpawn of all other abominations.

The very Word of the Scripture is, He that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son; as Faith is a coming to God by Jeſus Chriſt, ſo Unbelief is a departing from the living God. O take heed of it, as alſo of the ſin of Pride, which is a lifting and ſetting up our Wiſdom and Will, againſt the Wiſdom, Will, Word, Way and Work of God, preferring our own Honor before Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               </gap>e was the firſt and worſt ſin that could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted virtually, and interpretatively it is all iniquity; as all ſinners were in one, and came from one, ſo all ſins are ſummed up in this one, namely Pride, which is the Parent of all other abominations. The onely ſin that is ſo ſinful. This was the ſin that made good Angels Devils, and our firſt Parents and us evil, like unto them, yea, only evil, and that continually; by it we have loſt God, our ſelves, our knowledge of him, all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs, and all the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it is ſo deſperate a ſin, that it will not ſuffer any one to ſeek after God, his Grace and Glory. The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek after God, he will be happy without God. In ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, O ſeek firſt to be delivered from the pride of heart and life: otherwiſe you may ask and not have, ſeek and not find, knock and it ſhall not be opened unto you. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, which is Adultery and Idolatry, a loving and deſiring after the World, and the things of the World ſo inordinately and overcarefully, as both to neglect, and make light of the things of God which are above.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51635:87"/> The Covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth, his prayer and practice is, Lord, Who will ſhew us any good? his Labour is only for his mouth, and therefore his lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up much Goods for many years, is to take his eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry; he is one that layeth up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for himſelf, not caring to be rich towards God. O take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs; for a Mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the Things which he poſſeſſeth: And let our Converſation be without Covetouſneſs, content with ſuch Things as we have, ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe Things ſhall be added unto us; for the Lord hath ſaid, I will never leave you, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you: Covetouſneſs is but for Carnality; it caters for the fleſh, making proviſion for it, ſatisfying it in the Luſt thereof. The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. The Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Luſt of the Eyes are great Eye-ſores to Religion, and great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs. If we would be ſpiritually minded in ſeeking thoſe Things that are above, we muſt not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded, in ſeeking great Things for our ſelves here below. We can never fight the good Fight of Faith, or take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence, without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining and flying from fleſhly Luſts, which War againſt the Soul. Fleſhly perſons, who live after the Fleſh, in the Luſt of Uncleanneſs, can never be valiant Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers to fight under the Banner of Chriſt, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of Sin, Satan and the World, which muſt firſt be done, before the Kingdom of Heaven be taken. The Fleſh doth luſt againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are ſo contrary the one to the other, that we cannot do the Things we ſhould, while we walk in the Fleſh. Let us not therefore walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51635:87"/> to the Fleſh, or War after the Fleſh, for the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare are not carnal. Let not us be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but ſpiritual, putting on the whole Armor of God, which will be mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, and mortifying the deeds of the Body, namely fleſhly Luſts, which War againſt the Soul, that in all Things we may be more than Conquerors, through him who loves us, even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the World is crucified unto us, and we unto the World, as alſo the Fleſh; for they that are Chriſts, have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections, Paſſions, and Luſts, by whom alſo we reſiſt and overcome the Devil; for he was made Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil, the Works of the Fleſh, which are manifeſt to be Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, Idolatry, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Hatred, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings. Now they which follow ſuch Things, can neither ſeek or ever hope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Lying is another ſin which in a ſpecial manner is to be hated and avoided by us, if indeed we will ſet our ſelves heartily to ſeek the Kingdom of God; which is the uttering of an untruth with an intent and purpoſe to deceive, a ſin that transforms men into Devils: They who are given to Lying, are of their Father the Devil, who abode not in the Truth, becauſe there is no Truth in him; when he ſpeaketh a Lye, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a Lyar, and the Father of it. A lying Tongue is one of the ſeven Things the Lord hates, and is an abomination to him: Lying Lips are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, and therefore a righteous man hateth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51635:88"/> Lying; but they that deal truly, are Gods delight, and God is their delight; they that delight in the Lord, he will give them the deſire of their hearts, for the prayers of the upright are his delight: But they who delight in Lyes, who bleſs with their mouth, but curſe inwardly, without Repentance, are to be curſed eternally. The fearful and unbelieving, and all Lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death Let none who ſeek this Kingdom of God be like the Devil, a Lyar, but like God, who cannot lye. Let us fear to lye to the Holy Ghoſt, or to lye of, or to lye to one another by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> who were ſtruck dead with a Lye in their mouth: Wherefore with <hi>David,</hi> Let us hate and abhor Lying, and putting away Lying, ſpeak every man Truth with his Neighbour; for he only that ſpeaketh the Truth in his heart, is of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs; that ſeek and ſhall ſee the face of the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Take we heed alſo, and beware of the Leaven of Hypocriſie profeſſing what we mean not to practiſe, pleaſing our ſelves with a form of knowledge and godlineſs, denying the power of it. Hypocrites, they ſay, but do not; they pray, but practiſe not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but live not as they believe; they are Covenant makers, but not Covenant keepers; drawing near the Lord with their Mouths, and honouring him with their Lips, but removing their Heart far from him; with fl ttering Lips, and with a double Heart, do they ſpeak to God and man; there can be no faithfulneſs in their Mouth, for their inward part is very Wickedneſs: the Prayers and other Duties of ſuch wicked men, are an abomination to the Lord. Whatſoever is done in the great buſineſs of Salvation, is to be done heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men. If any man ſpeak, he is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51635:88"/> to ſpeak as the Oracles of God, not as pleaſing men, but God, which tryeth the Hearts, that God in all Things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; able with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle to call God to Witneſs, that ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Reading, ſearching, and meditating of the Holy Scriptures day and night, that the Word of Chriſt may dwell richly in us in all Wiſdom, with fervent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prayer before and after the duty, for the Spirit of Truth to ſanctifie us through the Truth; duties much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected both in Families, and in our private communion with the Lord, and I fear by too many of us ſlightly, indifferently, and indiligently done. Were the Word
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51635:90"/> of God read, ſearched and meditated daily by us as it ought to be, it would make us wiſer for our ſelves in all reſpects than we are; it is able to make even Children that exerciſe themſelves therein, wiſe unto ſalvation. It is very great pity, and a very great ſin it is, that every one that cannot, doth not learn to read, and every one that can doth not walk in Wiſdom, redeeming his time to ſearch theſe Sacred Records day and night, in which he thinks he hath eternal life. I make no doubt, but our moſt Gracious Sovereign the King, and Governors will, out of their Chriſtian Wiſdom, Care, Zeal and Charity, which in many things they have manifeſted, take order alſo, that all who are capable, both young and old in theſe Kingdoms, may be diligently taught to read the Holy Scriptures, that they periſh not for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſo the good Word of God may be daily read publickly in all Faimilies with Prayer and Praiſe, to the Praiſe and Glory of God, the Increaſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and their own immortal Honour: Which I daily pray may come to paſs, and am in a longing expectation of, as knowing, there is Wiſdom, Wealth and Willingneſs, Power and Prudence, every way Ability and Opportunity in you, our Governors and Counſellors, for the accompliſhing and effecting ſo great and good, and neceſſary and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Work; beſides the many Thouſands that wait for your Call, Command, Counſel, Countenance and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to aſſiſt herein; which labour of Love to ſo many periſhing Souls, will never be forgotten by the Lord; and the adminiſtration of this Service, will not only ſupply the want of Saints, but will be abundant alſo by many Thankſgivings unto God. Now the Lord make all Publick Perſons in Church and State Publick ſpirited herein, that the fruit of Righteouſneſs may be ſown in Peace, by them that make Peace to the Glory of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51635:90"/> God, and the Publick Good. Were the Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is not to depart out of our mouth, read and meditated therein day and night by us all, high and low, rich and poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we might obſerve to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that is written therein; this would make our way proſperous, then we ſhould do wiſely, and have good ſucceſs, eſpecially in ſeeking the Kingdom of Grace and Glory, which is our beſt Wiſdom to do, every one for himſelf, and each for other, till we find it, and attain it. Whoſoever delights in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth meditate day and night, ſhall be like a Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon, his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper; the univerſal faithful practice of theſe duties would, through the bleſſing of God, do Wonders among us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Examining our ſelves frequently and ſeriouſly by the Law and Goſpel, what effect they have had upon us as to the change of our ſtate from ſin to grace, from death to life; and whether our hearts and lives are ſo ſound in Gods Statutes, that we have reſpect to all his Commandments, that we may never be aſhamed. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this conſtant practice we cannot know our ſelves: Know ye not your own ſelves, ſaith the Apoſtle, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates. How ſhall we know our ſelves to be elect or reprobate, why examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves. If we wholly neglect, or negligently perform this duty, we may then certainly conclude our ſelves to be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. What are all the marks and ſigns for tryal of our everlaſting ſtate laid down in Scripture for, but that we might know our ſelves by them, whether we belong to God, or the Devil; and whether we are going to Heaven, or Hell. Without this careful, conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, trying and proving, a man may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51635:91"/> to be ſomething, when he is nothing, and ſo deceive himſelf, and others: Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into Heaven. Many will ſay to Chriſt on that great day of examination, Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils? And in thy Name done many wonderful Works? To whom he will profeſs, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity. Let every man therefore examine himſelf, and prove his own Work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another; then ſhall he not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things which Chriſt hath not wrought in him to the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if he ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in him. If every one that doth evil, and he that doth truth, would come to the light, it would make manifeſt whether their deeds were wrought in God or no: All things that are reproved or diſcovered, are made manifeſt by this light, for whatſoever doth make manifeſt is light; were this duty well managed, more would go to Heaven, and fewer to Hell.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conferring, talking, communing and reaſoning together in love concerning the things of the Kingdom of God, would be a happy means to help one another in ſeeking to find it: Too often our words in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying and praiſing to them that hear us, ſeem but idle Tales, and are not believed, till this Chriſtian duty of Communication be frequently exerciſed. Here we have liberty to ſpeak to one anothers capacities and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, we could not hear one another reaſoning of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell to come, but our hearts would burn within us, for Chriſt himſelf would be one amongſt us, as with his Diſciples at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> talking with us, and opening to us the Scriptures; ſo that our coming and communing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51635:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> together, would certainly be for the better, and not for the worſe; for this end, to revive the duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conference, I do fully purpoſe, by the Grace of God, as I have begun to bring the Holy Scriptures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Heads, that the Word of Chriſt may dwell richly in all wiſdom in young and old, that will exerciſe themſelves herein with delight and meditation day and night; for the accompliſhing whereof, the Prayers of all fearing God are again humbly and earneſtly deſired and expected.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Teaching Children early to read and know the Holy Scripture, Training them up, or Catechiſing them in the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and all others who have the like need that are but Children in knowledge, is another excellent means to increaſe the Kingdom of Chriſt. How many unprofitable, dull Hearers are there in theſe Kingdoms, which, for their time ought to be Teachers, have need that one teach them again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God; that, to their ſhame be it ſpoken, have not the knowledge of God, nay, that ſay to God and their Teachers whoſe lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at their mouth; for they are the meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes. Theſe have double neceſſity of counſel, care, and compaſſionate compulſion both from Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to learn, to know their duty, danger and neceſſity, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth, that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alive as captive by him at his will. The Harveſt truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few; pray we therefore the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt, ſuch as will preach not

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Often remembring and real renewing our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, whenever the Holy Sacraments are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. Baptiſm is but to be adminiſtred once, but we are ſolemnly and frequently to remember, and make uſe of our Baptiſmal Covenant upon all occaſions, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in avoiding all occaſions and temptations, and motions to ſin within or without, in time of tribulation and deſertion, and at the point of death; we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, wherein alſo we are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, that ſo many of us as are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptized into Jeſus Chriſt, are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his death, therefore are we buried with him by Baptiſm into death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life. By Baptiſm we are planted together in the likeneſs of his Death, and alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection, that our old man might be crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant making, and Covenant keeping, is the ſum of our Religion. We are ſworn in our Baptiſm to believe all the Articles of our Chriſtian Creed, and to live by faith,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51635:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> to walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs, to pray according to the Lords Prayer without ceaſing for Grace, that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and worldly luſts, we may live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent World, that ſo with comfort we may look for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and as we have ſworn, ſo we are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, even in keeping all the righteous Judgments of the Lord; ſo alſo the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which if there be opportunity, ſhould often be received by us, wherein we ſhew forth the death of Chriſt till he come, is another excellent means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, both to convey and aſſure to us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as alſo to ſtrengthen and confirm us in the Grace we have received, that we draw not back to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but going from faith to faith, from one degree of Grace unto another, we may receive the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our Souls. Let us ſhew the Lords death till he come, by often eating this Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Cup; but let us examine our ſelves, leſt eating and drinking unworthily, we be found guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and ſo eat and drink damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">III. All the Graces of the Holy Spirit muſt be had and exerciſed, we muſt go to the God of all Grace for every Grace, he will give Grace and Glory, firſt Grace, then Glory. It is through Grace we have good hope, the Grace of Regeneration according to his mercy; he ſaveth us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſheds on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being juſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hope of eternal life; there is no hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51635:93"/> life without Grace. It cannot be expected I ſhould diſcourſe of all the Graces, theſe may ſuffice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Grace we are to labour for, is Humility, by which we come to know our vileneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we are no better than wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and poor, and blind, and naked, and have need of every thing, and yet deſerve nothing; that we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God. The way to be rich in Grace, is to be poor in Spirit, God will give Grace to the humble; the more humble, the more holy; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefeſt of ſinners, leſs than the leaſt of all Saints in his own account: yet not a whit behind the very chiefeſt of the Apoſtles in Grace and Gifts, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more abundantly than they all; yet not I, ſaith he, but the Grace of God which was with me. Be cloathed with humility, walk humbly with God, humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt you in due time, God will ſave the humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Acquaint your ſelves with God, know the God of your Fathers; This is life eternal, to know thee the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent; the principal part of the image of God, is the knowledge of him. If you would have his mercy and his favor, you muſt have underſtanding; for to a people of no underſtanding, he that made them will not ſave them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favor; they who like not to retain God in their knowledge, are not like to go to Heaven; that the Soul be without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is not good, the Soul cannot be good without knowledge, it is the image of God which makes the Soul good. The new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; we eſcape the pollutions of the World through
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51635:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Grace alſo and Peace are multiplied unto us, through the knowledge of God and of Jeſus our Lord; yea, all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs are given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Virtue: Therefore if you determine to go to Heaven, determine not to know any thing ſo much as Jeſus Chriſt and him Crucified. Wiſdom is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing; therefore get Wiſdom, and with all thy getting, get Underſtanding, get Wiſdom, get Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orget it not, embrace her, and ſhe ſhall bring thee to Honour and Heaven. She is a Tree of Life, to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth her.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Repent and believe the Goſpel; I put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for brevity ſake, as I find them; Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus, are our very entrance into the Kingdom of God. True Repentance, which elſewhere I have deſcribed at large, lets the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sin and Satan out of the heart, that Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned may receive Chriſt and his Kingdom into it. Repentance is a turning from Sin and Satan, and the World, and Faith is a coming to God by Chriſt, a choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and cloſing with him as our Lord and Saviour, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of his Fulneſs, and Grace for Grace; that we may glorifie God, and be glorified with him in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Souls and Spirits, which are Gods. Seek firſt the Kingdom of God in a way of repenting and believing, and you are ſure to find it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fear of God, eſpecially for his Goodneſs, is another Grace to be deſired and laboured after towards the attainment of the Kingdom of God. Reverential filial fear of God, is the firſt beginning of true Wiſdom, which is the principal thing to be looked after. The fear of the Lord is the inſtruction of Wiſdom; What man
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51635:94"/> is he that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe. None are wiſe but fearers of God. Behold the fear of the Lord that is Wiſdom, and to depart from Evil is Underſtanding. The fear of the Lord, is to hate Evil, and the evil way, yea, every falſe way, which every prudent man is careful to do, that he may walk in the way of Life, which is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath; I know no greater or better wiſdom, than departing from Sin and Hell, for fear of God; to walk in wayes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of love to God, for the obtaining a Kingdom of Glory; whoſoever would receive a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let him have Grace, whereby he may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, paſſing the time of his ſojourning here in fear, working out his own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>Above all, put on Charity, no Grace brings us more into favor with God, and all good men, yea, even the worſt of men ſometimes than Charity. A man that is truly charitable both to Body and Soul, is a man almoſt by himſelf, and that hath that Charity which ſuffereth long, and is kind that envieth not, that behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, thinketh not evil, with all the other properties, is in a more excellent way to the Kingdom of Glory, than any other; and therefore my advice is, that every one would ſtrive to excel in this moſt excellent Gift, Duty and Grace of Charity; that he would follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Charity, till he be found in Charity; an example in Charity, fervent in Charity, in that Charity that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a multitude of ſins; that the Charity of every one of us all towards each other abounding, all our things may be done in Charity, that ſo we may be in Charity one with another, which is the end of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the bond of our perfection. O the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51635:95"/> excellencies of Faith and Hope, and other Graces, but the greateſt of them all is Charity; Charity makes a man ſo good, that when one will ſcarcely dye for a righteous, or juſt man, peradventure for a good or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable man ſome would even dare to dye, if not, he dare dye for himſelf, or for the Brethren, which he ought to do, when lawfully called thereunto. None in ſo ſure and ſafe a way to the Kingdom of Glory, as a man of Charity. Put on therefore (as the Elect of God) bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, as Chriſt forgave you, but above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction, and beſides being partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and giving all diligence to add to faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs add Charity; for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To Charity, add alſo Chaſtity; which is a virtue not only neceſſary and preparatory, but eſſential to the Kingdom of God: for there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lye. Having therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for this end, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God, that we, who according to promiſe look for new He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. Get Self-denial; Live in the daily practice of it, if you would not have God deny you himſelf, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51635:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> Grace and Glory; if any man will come after Chriſt, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow him: He muſt go the ſame way that Chriſt went, that means to come to Heaven; he hath led us the way, for he is our way, he himſelf went every ſtep to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a way of Self-denial, his wiſdom, will, way and work, was wholly ſubjected to the wiſdom, will and pleaſure of his heavenly Father: I ſeek not, ſaith he, mine own Will, but the Will of the Father which hath ſent me, and I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him; every one of us is to pleaſe his Neighbour for his good to edification, and the reaſon is, for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, leaving us an example, that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps. Our own wiſdom, will and way, ſtanding either in competition with, or oppoſition unto the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which ſeems fooliſhneſs to us, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; the world by wiſdom knows neither God, nor his Son Jeſus Chriſt. The hidden wiſdom which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before the World unto our Glory, is ſuch a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that none of the Princes of this World knew, and therefore they crucified the Lord of Glory. Nor can any natural man receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: Let no man therefore deceive himſelf, if any man ſeem to be wiſe in this World, let him deny himſelf, become a Fool, that he may be wiſe to deny his own Will, as well as his own Wiſdom; that he may be willing in the day of Gods power, to be what God would have him to be, and to ſay, not my Will, but thine be done on Earth as it is in Heaven, which is the higheſt Wiſdom. Self-love muſt alſo be denied: Naturally men, though they will not own it, are Lovers of their own ſelves, which makes them covetous, and proud, to be Lovers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, more than Lovers of God. The love of God for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51635:96"/> himſelf, and love to our Neighbours, without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is the cure of Self-love, which is falſe love, and therefore true hatred. Self-love is Self-hatred. The Times are perilous, when men are Lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud, Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lovers of God, having a form of Godlineſs, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power thereof. Hold faſt the form of ſound words with a ſound mind by the Spirit of Faith, and of Power, and of Love; that inſtead of denying the power of Godlineſs, you may exerciſe your ſelves unto all Godlineſs, in denying Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts: that you may live ſoberly, righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent evil World. Learn in what ſtate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are in, therewith to be content. Learn both how to be abaſed, and know how to abound. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be poor in this World, which is the true meaning of being poor in Spirit, that you may be rich in Faith, and Heirs of a Kingdom; the comfort and content of a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth. The Kingdom of God is not meat and dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God is to be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, he is rich in mercy, but to whom? to them that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in Truth. The good and the right way is, only fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Truth with all your heart. God is for the heart, and the whole heart; man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart; the heart, and the ſincerity of it, is all in all with God; Grace and Mercy is with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity with incorruption.

God is good to thoſe that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> intimates in his Prayer. None are good indeed, but the upright and ſincere, their hearts are good, their lives are good, they are like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> lovely and pleaſant in their lives, and their death is precious in the ſight of the Lord. Mark the perfect man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the upright, for the end of that man is Peace. He
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51635:97"/> ſhall enter into Peace, that walketh before God in Truth, and with a perfect heart, doing that which is good in his ſight; uprightneſs, integrity, and ſincerity in heart, ſpeech and behaviour, is very pleaſing to God. Behold thou delighteſt in, or deſireſt Truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, They onely are the Sons of God, who are blameleſs, harmleſs, or ſincere, ſpeaking the Truth in love, as being ſincere, which is all one; ſpeaking the Truth from the heart, is a character of a Citizen of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the property and duty of the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are not as many, which deal deceitfully with, or corrupt the Word of God, but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak they in Chriſt his Doctrine, ſhewing uncorruptneſs, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech, that cannot be condemned; ordering alſo their Converſations in the World, by the grace of God in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, that they may approve things that are excellent, that they may be ſincere and without offence toward God and toward man, till the day of Chriſt. They who are allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, are even ſo to ſpeak and live, not as pleaſing men, but God, which tryeth their hearts; not at any time uſing flattering words, for a cloak of covetouſneſs, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Brethren to mark: And I moſt humbly beſeech His moſt peaceable Majeſty, for His own, and His Kingdoms ſake and ſafety, He would alſo mark them who cauſe Diviſions and Offences upon what pretences ſoever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the State, or Church, or Families, contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, for they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly; and by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, walking in craftineſs, doing the work of the Lord deceitfully: But ſuch as would firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God with comfort, muſt labour to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51635:97"/> in whom is no guile, that they may grow in grace, in every grace, going from grace to grace, from ſtrength to ſtrength; for the pure in heart, and he that hath clean hands, and is ſincere, perfect and undefiled in the way, ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger, till he be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, being ſtrengthned with might by his Spirit in the inner man, to exerciſe himſelf in all holy converſation and godlineſs, in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in every relation; for the truth and ſtrength of grace lies much in relative religiouſneſs. None are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, that are not relatively holy; they who are not good, loyal and ſincere loving Subjects to His moſt Excellent Majeſty the King, are far from the true power of godlineſs, and ſo in all other Relations, which I leave to a fitter opportunity to handle. What more plain in all the Word of God, than that every Soul is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the higher Powers? How apt are men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it! Put them in mind therefore, ſaith <hi>St. Paul,</hi> to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: What follows—To be ready to every good Work: Why? for Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil. He is a Miniſter of God to every one for good, both to the good and to the evil, to make evil men good, and good men better. The Supreme Power, which is the Ordinance of God, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, upon pain of damnation; but all Dues, Duties, Tribute, Cuſtom, Fear, Honour, the rather to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all chearfulneſs, and humble thankfulneſs: for Magiſtrates are Gods Miniſters, attending continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this very thing; wherefore let every one of us, as it is our bounden duty, ſhew the truth and power of our godlineſs herein, for we muſt needs be Subjects, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake, to our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in the Lord: And that they may rule for God, and for good, let Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51635:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> and giving of Thanks be made by us all for the KING, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men firſt to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and come unto the knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the acknowledging of the Truth, which is after godlineſs, that they may be ſaved: for which end the Divine Power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of God and Jeſus our Lord, that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe we might be partakers of the divine nature, and the divine life.</p>

Let us comfort one another with theſe words, God and Chriſt, and Grace and Glory are ours, we are ſealed with that holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his glory, all things are ours, for we are Chriſts; <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> the world, life, death, things preſent, things to come, all are ours in poſſeſſion and reverſion. This <hi>All</hi> ſhould comfort us, it is worth being a Son, a Saint, a Servant of God, to be as rich as Heaven and Earth, yea richer, in having God for our portion. Let not the Conſolations of God ſeem ſmall to us; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, are all ours, here are the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, treaſured up for the heirs of promiſe, wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto them the immutability of his counſel, confirmed them by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us, which is Chriſt in us, the hope of glory: for we look for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51635:99"/> to be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and they in him. Its worth going through the Kingdom of grace all the way, which many poor Chriſtians are fain to do in a way of perſecution and tribulation, to the Kingdom of glory, where they ſhall ever be with the Lord, whoſe preſence will make amends for all. There God and Chriſt will be all, and in all, here Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in our hearts by faith, hope, and love; but when Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, we ſhall alſo appear with him in glory; then ſhall we be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge; now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is; then ſhall we be filled with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that will do for us exceeding abundantly above all that now we ask or think, unto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all ages world without end.</p>
            <q>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father which hath loved us, and hath given us everlaſting Conſolation, and good hope through grace, comfort our hearts, and eſtabliſh us in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Work, to keep us from falling, till we be preſented faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy.
